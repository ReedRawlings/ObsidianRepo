We over analyze the smallest flaws but let our greatest strengths go unnoticed.

---
The best ideas are worthless without execution.

Even at their most rudimentary implementations, LLMs allow you to take that first step toward execution.

---
You can’t plan for every possible outcome, but you can prepare for failure and setbacks. Recognize what you control. Do not let yourself be hamstrung by inconvenience when pushing through brings you back on the path toward success

---
Those who want to justify their actions will do so at your expense regardless of your innocence. These people are the worst of the worst. Unable to accept responsibility for their actions. Run from them. Do not look back.

---
The people who love you will encourage you to pursue your interests because they see the joy you have while pursuing them. Then, it is your responsibility to share that joy with them rather than the interest itself.

Return the kindness. Ask them what you could do to help them pursue their interests. Do not push yours on them.

“Who acts in haste repents at leisure”

---
People despise most in others the worst parts of themselves

---
A competitor can make you stronger or weaker. The choice is yours.

---
If you want to better others, first better yourself

---
When you know what you need it becomes easy to avoid only what you want.

---
Dominance in one domain does not guarantee dominance in all domains.

---
The right answer to the wrong problem is the wrong answer. Be cautious when you believe you understand a problem well enough to solve it.

I see young men abuse themselves all the time because they “just can’t focus”, they never question whether or not the thing they want to focus on matters enough for them to focus on.

I need to understand economics to master the markets, learn finance to be a better day-trader, study computer science to get a well-paying job. These force themselves into different niches to satisfy an overarching goal of wealth. And, if you ask them why they want this, it’s always for another reason altogether.

“I don’t want to be poor”

“I want to find a good wife and women want a man with money”

“I want to be powerful and being rich is the easiest way to get there”

They want the things they perceive money will buy them and then looking for the quickest way to get there.

Right answers, wrong problems.

---
The fastest way to peace of mind is to avoid those who complain and argue at every step of the way.

---
“Whatever you do, do with all your might”

---
If you act like a piece of shit online don’t be surprised when that attitude starts to leak into your personal life. There will never be a clear separation to who you are in one community and who you are in the next.

---
Riding high on the coattails of others is a sure fire way to live a flashy, empty life.

---
Count your money when it’s in your hand. If you’re tempted to count if before, sell. Sell immediately. You have reached a personal number that matters to you and there are infinite more opportunities.

No one ever went broke taking profits.

---
“Those who do not know their rightful place must be taught it”

---
“Pleasure is heightened by abstinence”

---
Fake it til you make it is not the same as false confidence. The former means planning, working, striving, embodying the person you will become. False confidence is easy to see through. That nothing is as important as putting on airs.

---
Once you notice temptation, you’re bound to fall victim to it. You should do your best to avoid it. Otherwise you’ll be forced to exert your willpower and most don’t have the capacity to do that often.

---
When solving problems, improving habits, changing your character - don’t be so eager. You must understand what you’re trading your behaviors for.

---
No arguments will give courage to a coward

---
When people want to make changes in their lives they try to do everything at once. They figure, if I’m going to change one thing, why not change everything? They start new gym routines, they study hardy, spend more time with friends, clean their homes, start applying for new jobs.

All of this lasts a few days at most before shock sets in. They realize how overwhelming it all is. They stop believing in themselves and soon give up.

If they had started any of these alone, a week or two at a time before stacking the others, success would have been far easier to achieve.

---
How do you think your character would change if you had everything you wished?

---
What a waste it is to continue arguing well into the worst tangents just to be right rather than solve a problem.

---
Even the most insignificant bad habits can go a long way in setting your life up toward failure.
