<center><h1>The Meme Machine</h1></center>
Everything is a meme at some level. The clothes we wear, the way we style our hair, how we communicate with one another, the words we favor, even the jobs we do. Few things left in our society our natural. They do not exist for the sake of our livelihoods but by the insistence of our culture.

Religions are peak expressions of memetics and in the near future new religions and modes of thinking will spawn from the endless interactions of artificial intelligence and society.

We’ve set up a perfect playground for memetics to spread and now we have nothing left to do but reap what we’ve sown.

~~People who talk more have a higher propensity to have their memes replicated. Similarly people who speak less frequently, but with more weight, have a higher likelihood of getting their memes spread. The latter approach is more efficient, but hard to come by. You need to have a history of experience to demonstrate your opinion holds value over others.~~

~~Those who can should leverage the shotgun approach. If your ideas end up being implemented more often than not, people will assume you have knowledge they don’t and come to rely on you.~~

Genes and memetics often fight one another. Men view sleeping around as a good thing for men to do. The pleasure, power, and satisfaction that comes from being wanted is euphoric, and in our society, demonstrates that we have some power over the opposite sex. This is a memetic view of sexual relationships. Helps spread “What a chad”

The genetic view might have men sleep around, but only as a driver to find strong, fertile partners to help raise their children. Helps spread a mans seed.

In a memetic view of the world, men never need to grow up and take responsibility for their actions. They may pretend to do so to further their memetic goals (fuck boy behavior), but are never serious. It is “good” of them to be whores.

You might say, “but Dick, surely the first scenario also spreads a mans genetics everywhere.” That might be true to some extent, but few women will carry that child to term because they know the man is irresponsible and can’t be bothered to help raise his kid.

Worse, the memetic view is far easier to spread and has more social implications. We don’t really hold good fathers up in society (though we should), but we do put men who sleep around on a pedestal.

Only solution to problems like these is too realign the memes to get closer to our genetics. Praise great fathers, demonize men who waste women’s time.

Imitating others and being part of an in-group are rewarding behaviors on their own. Feelings of belonging are one of the ways that memes spread.

You can grow at incredible speeds because you never run out of attempts. You can just keep trying new things. Your capacity for growth is limitless.

Crypto is a perfect meme because it presses so many memetic buttons.

If you “get” crypto you already fall into a highly unified group of outsiders (a place dejected males like to belong). It’s money; one of the primary memetic truths. It captures variety of other modern memes; affront to authority, getting rich quick, anonymity, libertarianism, lifting yourself up by your bootstraps, and virality.

Men who can spread memes are likely better mates than men who are rich. If a man can spread ideas he is likely to command respect, form stronger relationships, and be a better leader. Similarly he can pass these traits down to his children.

A wealthy man can provide wealth to his children, but may not be able to teach them how to earn it themselves OR how to use it to gain the

same things that the meme-spreader can.

What I’m trying to say is, if you’re chronically online, there is hope.

If you’re wondering why people won’t listen to you try being cheery instead of a piece of shit.
