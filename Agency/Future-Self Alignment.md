## Brief Outline

### Introduction
- You skip the gym today; future-you pays the price
- You scroll instead of working on your side project; future-you stays stuck
- You eat the cake; future-you deals with the consequences
- Every decision is a vote for or against your future self
- Agency isn't just about acting - it's about acting toward who you want to become

### Part 1: The Future-Self Problem
- **Present bias**: We prioritize immediate rewards over future benefits
- Your brain treats "future you" as a stranger
- Research: fMRI scans show thinking about your future self activates same regions as thinking about strangers
- **The disconnect**: Future-you's needs feel abstract; present-you's desires feel urgent
- **The result**: We make decisions that screw over our future self
- Examples:
  - Staying up late (present-you wants fun; future-you needs sleep)
  - Spending instead of saving (present-you wants the thing; future-you needs security)
  - Procrastinating (present-you wants comfort; future-you needs the work done)

### Part 2: The Identity Dimension of Agency
- Most people optimize for who they are, not who they want to become
- **The trap**: "I'm not a morning person" keeps you not a morning person
- **The reframe**: "I'm becoming someone who wakes up early"
- **James Clear**: Every action is a vote for the identity you want to build
- Agency isn't just doing things - it's doing things that align with future-you
- The question: "What would the person I want to become do right now?"

### Part 3: Visualizing Your Future Self
- The more vividly you imagine future-you, the more you care about them
- **Exercise**: Write a detailed description of who you want to be in 5 years
  - What does a typical day look like?
  - What habits do they have?
  - How do they spend their time?
  - What have they accomplished?
  - How do they feel about their life?
- **Research**: People who visualize their future self make better long-term decisions
- Make future-you feel real, not abstract

### Part 4: The Temporal Discounting Problem
- **Temporal discounting**: The further in the future, the less we value it
- $100 today feels more valuable than $150 in a year
- Immediate pleasure feels more valuable than long-term health
- **Why this kills agency**:
  - The benefits of agentic behavior are often delayed
  - The discomfort is immediate
  - Your brain defaults to "now" over "later"
- **The solution**: Shorten the time horizon
  - Think about tomorrow-you, not decade-from-now-you
  - "Will I regret this tomorrow morning?"

### Part 5: Making Decisions Your Future Self Will Thank You For
- **The Future-Self Test**: Before deciding, ask:
  - "Will future-me thank me for this?"
  - "Am I solving a problem or creating one?"
  - "Is this aligned with who I want to become?"
- Examples:
  - Going to bed on time → Future-you wakes up grateful
  - Cooking instead of ordering out → Future-you has money and health
  - Having the difficult conversation → Future-you doesn't carry resentment
  - Starting the project now → Future-you has progress
- Each aligned decision builds trust with future-you

### Part 6: Present-You vs. Future-You Conflicts
- What happens when present-you and future-you want different things?
- **Common conflicts**:
  - Present-you wants comfort; future-you wants growth
  - Present-you wants to avoid embarrassment; future-you wants to have tried
  - Present-you wants to stay up; future-you wants to feel rested
  - Present-you wants the short-term pleasure; future-you wants long-term results
- **The resolution**:
  - Recognize the conflict (most people don't)
  - Decide whose side you're on (hint: it should usually be future-you)
  - Act accordingly, despite discomfort

### Part 7: Building Trust With Your Future Self
- Every time you follow through, you build trust
- Every time you betray future-you, you lose it
- **The cycle of mistrust**:
  - You set a goal → Don't follow through → Stop believing in yourself → Stop trying
- **The cycle of trust**:
  - You commit → Follow through → Believe you can → Set bigger goals
- Your relationship with your future self is the most important relationship you have
- Treat future-you like someone you care about

### Part 8: The Identity Shift Strategy
- **Current identity**: "I'm not a morning person"
- **Transitional identity**: "I'm becoming someone who wakes up early"
- **Future identity**: "I'm someone who wakes up early"
- **How to shift**:
  - Small consistent actions aligned with future identity
  - Language shifts ("I don't" vs. "I'm working on")
  - Surrounding yourself with people who have that identity
  - Celebrating evidence of the new identity
- Each action in alignment makes the identity more real

### Part 9: The Compound Effect of Alignment
- Every decision either moves you toward or away from future-you
- **Alignment compounds**:
  - One good decision makes the next easier
  - Momentum builds
  - Identity solidifies
  - Future-you arrives sooner
- **Misalignment compounds**:
  - One bad decision makes the next easier
  - Momentum toward the wrong direction
  - Identity of "someone who doesn't follow through" solidifies
  - Future-you keeps getting pushed further away
- The gap between who you are and who you want to be is made of daily decisions

### Part 10: When Future-You Changes
- Sometimes who you thought you wanted to become isn't right
- Your goals shift, your values change, your circumstances evolve
- **That's okay** - alignment doesn't mean rigidity
- The question isn't "Am I still on the exact path I planned?"
- It's "Are my actions today aligned with who I want to be tomorrow?"
- Regularly check in: Is this still who I want to become?
- Course-correct as needed

### Part 11: Practical Future-Self Alignment Strategies
- **Strategy 1: The Letter From Future-You**
  - Write a letter from 5-years-from-now you
  - What do they wish you had started today?
  - What are they grateful you did?
- **Strategy 2: The Evening Review**
  - Before bed: "Did today's actions align with who I want to become?"
  - Celebrate alignment, adjust for tomorrow
- **Strategy 3: The Decision Matrix**
  - For big decisions: Write how present-you feels vs. how future-you will feel
  - Choose based on future-you's perspective
- **Strategy 4: The Identity Statement**
  - "I am someone who [desired identity trait]"
  - Refer to it when deciding
- **Strategy 5: Pre-Commitment**
  - Make future-aligned decisions now that constrain future choices
  - Sign up for the class, book the flight, tell people your goal

### Conclusion
- Agency isn't just about action - it's about aligned action
- Every choice is either a gift to your future self or a burden
- Present-you and future-you are in a relationship - nurture it
- The person you want to become is built by what you do today
- Make decisions future-you will thank you for
- Visualize them, connect with them, act on their behalf
- You won't become who you want to be by accident
- Alignment is agency pointed in the direction of your best self
- Start today: Ask "What would the person I want to become do right now?" - then do it
