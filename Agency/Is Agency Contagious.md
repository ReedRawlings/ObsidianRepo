## Brief Outline

### Introduction
- You start going to the gym; your roommate joins you two weeks later
- You quit drinking; suddenly three friends are "cutting back"
- You start a side business; your coworkers start talking about their ideas
- Agency spreads, but not the way you'd expect
- The question: Can one person's agency inspire or erode others?

### Part 1: The Social Proof Mechanism
- **Humans are mimetic**: We copy what we see, not what we're told
- **Social proof**: "If they're doing it, maybe I can too"
- **Permission by example**: Your action gives others implicit permission
- Why this works:
  - Reduces perceived risk ("They survived doing it")
  - Makes the invisible visible ("I didn't know that was an option")
  - Provides a template ("Here's what taking action looks like")
- Historical examples:
  - Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott
  - The first person to stand up in a movement
  - Four-minute mile: Once Roger Bannister did it, many others followed

### Part 2: Leading by Example vs. Preaching
- **Preaching**: "You should do X" - often creates resistance
- **Example**: Doing X yourself - often creates curiosity
- Why example works better:
  - No one likes being told what to do
  - Actions are proof; words are just opinions
  - People trust what you do more than what you say
- The trap of preaching:
  - "You need to set boundaries!" while you have none
  - "You should start a business!" while you're still employed
  - Advice without skin in the game rings hollow
- **The principle**: Be the change you want to see in your social circle

### Part 3: The Visibility Factor
- Agency spreads when it's visible
- **Visible agency**: Asking for a discount in front of friends, starting a business publicly, setting boundaries others witness
- **Invisible agency**: Private decisions, internal changes, solo pursuits
- Both matter, but only visible agency is contagious
- **The mechanism**: Others see you do it → They realize it's possible → They try it themselves
- Making your agency visible:
  - Talk about what you're building
  - Share the process, not just outcomes
  - Be honest about challenges (makes it relatable)
  - Invite others along (not as a requirement, as an option)

### Part 4: The Narrative Effect
- Stories are how agency spreads across time and distance
- You hear about someone who:
  - Quit their job and traveled the world
  - Started a company in their garage
  - Went back to school at 40
  - Left a toxic relationship
- The story plants a seed: "If they could, maybe I could"
- **Why stories work**:
  - They expand your sense of what's possible
  - They provide a roadmap (even if rough)
  - They normalize unconventional choices
- Your story is data for others' decision-making

### Part 5: The Permission Paradox
- "Cursed. We can't force them to have agency, because that would completely destroy the point of agency"
- You can't make someone be agentic
- Pushing too hard creates reactance (they resist to maintain autonomy)
- **The paradox**: To help someone gain agency, you have to let them choose
- **What you can do**:
  - Model it
  - Remove barriers
  - Offer support (not pressure)
  - Create environments where agency is encouraged
- **What you can't do**:
  - Force them to act
  - Make their decisions for them
  - Shame them into changing

### Part 6: Creating High-Agency Environments
- Agency flourishes in certain conditions:
  - **Psychological safety**: Mistakes won't be punished harshly
  - **Autonomy**: People have genuine choice
  - **Modeling**: Leaders demonstrate agency themselves
  - **Resources**: Information and tools are accessible
  - **Encouragement**: Agency is celebrated, not suppressed
- Environments that kill agency:
  - Authoritarian structures (do what you're told)
  - Punitive consequences for initiative
  - Gatekeeping of information or resources
  - Social pressure to conform
- If you're a leader, manager, parent, or teacher:
  - Give people problems, not solutions
  - Ask "What do you think you should do?" instead of telling them
  - Celebrate attempts, not just successes
  - Let them fail safely

### Part 7: The Responsibility of High-Agency People
- With agency comes visibility
- Others are watching what you do
- Your choices ripple outward
- **The responsibility**:
  - Be honest about the costs (not just the benefits)
  - Don't gatekeep or credentialize (agency doesn't require permission)
  - Support others when they reach out
  - Don't shame people for being where you used to be
- **The trap**: "I did it, so everyone should be able to"
  - Ignores context, privilege, resources, circumstances
  - Creates shame instead of inspiration
  - Be honest about what helped you

### Part 8: When Agency Erodes Agency
- **The dark side**: Sometimes high-agency people suppress others
- **How it happens**:
  - Taking over instead of empowering
  - Solving everyone's problems for them
  - Creating dependencies ("I'll handle it")
  - Not leaving space for others to step up
- High-agency parents who don't let kids make decisions
- High-agency leaders who micromanage
- High-agency partners who take over all planning
- **The balance**: Use your agency to create space for others' agency

### Part 9: Measuring the Spread
- How do you know if your agency is contagious?
- **Signs**:
  - People ask you how you did X
  - Friends start taking similar actions
  - Others cite you as inspiration (even small things)
  - Your social circle's average agency increases
- **Not the goal**: Everyone copying you exactly
- **The goal**: Everyone finding their own expression of agency
- Success isn't uniformity; it's each person living more intentionally

### Conclusion
- Agency is contagious, but only through example, not preaching
- Your actions give others permission to try
- You can't force anyone to have agency - that's the whole point
- What you can do: Model it, share your process, create safe environments
- Be visible in your agency; stories spread further than you think
- High-agency people have a responsibility to lift others, not just themselves
- The ripple effect is real: One person's agency can change a family, a friend group, a workplace
- Be the first one to act - others will follow when they're ready
