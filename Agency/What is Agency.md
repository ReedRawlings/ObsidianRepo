<center><h1>What is Agency?</h1></center>
I am defining agency as,

> The bridge between thought and action. Explicitly when those actions are aligned with one's self-interest, goals, or allow them to assert their presence and advocate for themselves.

Agency then, should not exist in a vacuum. A person who only works in their own self-interest or goals is unlikely to benefit society.

The Hulk is a completely agentic being. It exists for itself. He runs on free will and rage. There are no boundaries and his actions have no consequences. Similarly, he has no long-term goals and almost no impact on his own or the future of others. 

Maximizing your agency is akin to unadulterated free will. The homeless man who shits in public likely has more agency than you, but you aren't awestruck when he does this. 

Instead, you should think of people like Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Joe Rogan, Alexandra Ocasio Cortez, Bernie Sanders, Martin Luther King Jr or any man and women whose had radical shifts in their life and career, put voice to power, or pursued their dreams regardless of outcome or perception.

However, all of these individuals had a driving force behind their actions. It is not action for actions sake, but introspection, luck, radical belief in themselves that gave them purpose and then, through action, allowed them to achieve their goals.

Now that you understand agency you might have some questions like,
- [[#Improving Agency|Can I improve my agency?]]
- [[#Lack of Agency|Do I lack agency?]]
- [[#Improving Agency|Why should I improve my agency?]]
- [[#Expression of Agency|How do others express their agency?]]
- [[#The Traits, Skills, and Beliefs of Agency| What skills, traits, or beliefs relate to agency?]]

## The Value Proposition of Agency
Any person can experience agency. Anyone can harness it for themselves. Those who are truly successful always have agency. You can not excel in life without it. 

The value proposition of agency is not agency alone, but what it allows a self-aligned individual to accomplish.

To maximize agency at the expense of it's related skills, traits, and beliefs creates a mindless machine that acts on whim rather than wisdom.

A person who combines agency with introspection, resilience, communication, autonomy, and locus of control becomes a master of their environment. The only thing between them and a wildly successful life is time and luck.
## Improving Agency
You can improve your agency. It's far easier than you'd imagine. You only need to exist outside a position of power. There may be a handful of people in the world that sentence doesn't apply to. You are not one of them. This is a wonderful revelation! It means you have will have daily opportunities to improve.

Below is a list of agency exercises. You can attempt any of these and simultaneously increase many of agencies related skills. I am partial to this list because I have done many of these myself and found that none of them were difficult to implement and all were well received by their counterparties. After all, no one wants to have dissatisfied customers. 
### Every Day Practice
This list is nearly limitless. The things you do daily might look drastically different from me. If they do, the list below should be enough to get your wheels churning. If you live in an isolated environment or you've chosen to self-isolate there are many opportunities online to express your agency. 
#### Solo
- Ignoring the tipping sign.
- Studying for next years coursework over the summer
- Ask a flight attendant for extra snacks
- Find a new doctor or dentist AND scheduling an appointment
- Choose what you'll eat every night for a week (if with a partner)
- Returning a poorly done meal or drink
- Reaching out to people. Cold calling, cold emails, message on a social media platform.
- Ask to work in on a busy machine at the gym
- Declining an invitation outright (no hedging)
- Asking for help
- Making a return
- Asking for clarification
- Say a few words to a stranger
- Posting on social media (if you don't already)
- Negotiating a price
- Lifting the parking garage arm after it's eaten your payment instead of waiting for an attendant. 
- Replenish the paper towels in a restaurant bathroom is they've run out. They are almost always under the sink. 
#### Group
- Initiating an event for your friends or family
- Organizing a team outing at your work
- Speaking up in a meeting
- Shifting tables and chairs around for you and your party at a gathering so everyone can sit together
### Generalized Agency
Once you've practiced agency in enough micro situations you'll need to start looking for more ways to exert yourself. These are less easy to define, but broadly appear as you choosing actions that align with your beliefs rather than letting your social group dictate for you. 

- Choosing what language is appropriate to use rather than letting society dictate for you.
- Pursuing your interests and passions rather than worrying about how others will view you.
- Doing what's right instead of the bare minimum. 

Be careful! Exerting your agency, especially in dynamics where you lack power, is dangerous. It often means going against people exerting their authority or even their own agency. These moments are rife for conflict. This can be a moment to practice resilience or simply understand the dynamics between agency <> agency and agency <> authority.


## Expression of Agency
Agency can be expressed in a number of ways. It's often discussed as a tenant of "success", but there are many high agency people who only have moderate financial success. I'd guess they are happier on average though. 

When I look at people in my life who are high agency here are the actions I see them taking or the characteristics they often exude. 

- Choosing to end relationships that don't align with your values
- Setting boundaries around post work communication
- They "get what they want"
- Taking initiative to build new skills before they're required
- Addressing conflicts rather than hoping they resolve themselves
- A patient researching treatment options and advocating for themselves
- Community members organizing to affect local government
- They are considered "blunt" or "deeply honest"
- Starting a difficult conversation
- Creating opportunities rather than waiting for them
- Choosing to change careers despite sunk costs
- Starting a business
- Taking initiative rather than waiting for direction
- Resisting external pressures that conflict with values
- Creating your own learning path rather than following preset curricula

This is not an exhaustive list. I bet I'm missing many important examples. If you believe I am please reach out!
## Lack of Agency
Most of us live passive lives. It's almost impossible not to. Our education system creates repetitive environments where acting out of line is heavily discourage. This process extends into college and if autonomy isn't beaten out of you by then entering the workforce will finish you off. 

Thankfully, this means each of these environments are brimming with moments to exert agency (and make yourself look good at the same time). 

I've compiled a list of traits and characteristics that exemplify those with low agency. Checking a single box doesn't necessarily mean you lack agency, but a few of these combined is a good signal. 

- An external locus of control. 
- A fear of failure. 
- Fear of humiliation
- You avoid making decisions or default to having others choose for you. 
- You rely on others to tell you what to do. 
- You rely on others to solve your problems.  
- You rehearse defeatist narratives. 
- Inability to dream
- Ask for permission rather than taking initiative. 
- Hesitates to voice dissent or disagreement. 

Reading through this list and examining which best align to your life and behaviors is an opportunity to practice introspection, a core skill for exceptional autonomy. 

As you analyze your life, take the opportunity to look for ways you can start exerting agency. Many of these signals align with the [[#Every Day Practice|"every day practice"]] section of improving agency. 
## The Traits, Skills, and Beliefs of Agency
Agency is not a standalone skill. It is not something you should maximize for compared to many of it's related traits and skills. Here I've compiled a more exhaustive list. If you're looking to improve your agency you can likely do so by working on anything in this list. 

Skills provide the tools to act and traits provide the foundation for effort. 
Traits provide the motivation and ability to exert agency.
