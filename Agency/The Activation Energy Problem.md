## Brief Outline

### Introduction
- You know what you need to do, but you don't do it
- The space between intention and action is where agency dies
- The problem isn't lack of motivation - it's activation energy
- Starting requires overcoming inertia; continuing is comparatively easy

### Part 1: The Physics of Agency
- **Newton's First Law for humans**: Objects at rest stay at rest, objects in motion stay in motion
- Inertia applies to behavior, not just physics
- The effort to start is always greater than the effort to continue
- Examples:
  - Getting to the gym is harder than working out
  - Opening the document is harder than writing
  - Making the call is harder than having the conversation
  - Leaving the house is harder than the social event
- Why: Starting requires overcoming the default state (rest)

### Part 2: What Is Activation Energy?
- Chemistry definition: Minimum energy needed to start a reaction
- Human behavior translation: The mental/physical effort required to begin
- High activation energy actions:
  - Applying for jobs (resume, cover letter, finding listings)
  - Starting a business (LLC, website, marketing, product)
  - Going to the gym (change clothes, pack bag, drive there)
  - Having a difficult conversation (emotional preparation, finding time, initiating)
- Low activation energy actions:
  - Scrolling social media (phone already in hand)
  - Watching Netflix (one click)
  - Staying in bed (literally zero effort)
- **The problem**: High-value actions usually have high activation energy

### Part 3: Why Activation Energy Kills Agency
- Humans are cognitive misers - we default to low-effort options
- Every step between thought and action is a chance to quit
- Decision fatigue: Every micro-decision drains willpower
- "Should I go?" → "What should I wear?" → "Do I have my stuff?" → *Too tired, staying home*
- The more steps required, the less likely you are to start
- The gap between "I should" and "I'm doing it" is where agency dies

### Part 4: Reducing Activation Energy
- **The principle**: Make starting so easy it's harder to avoid than to do
- **Strategy 1: Reduce steps**
  - Sleep in gym clothes → No "getting ready" step
  - Meal prep on Sunday → No "what should I make?" step
  - Pre-write difficult emails as templates → No "how do I phrase this?" step
- **Strategy 2: Remove friction**
  - Put running shoes by the door
  - Delete time-wasting apps from your phone
  - Set up automatic bill pay
  - Have dumbbells in your living room
- **Strategy 3: Automate the decision**
  - Same gym time every day → No "when should I go?" decision
  - Meal plans → No "what should I eat?" decision
  - Morning routine → No negotiating with yourself

### Part 5: The 2-Minute Rule for Agency
- Make the first step absurdly small
- "Put on gym clothes" not "work out for an hour"
- "Write one sentence" not "finish the chapter"
- "Send one email" not "apply to 10 jobs"
- "Call and ask for the appointment desk" not "schedule and prepare for doctor visit"
- The trick: Starting creates momentum; you'll usually continue
- Lower the barrier until it feels ridiculous to not do it

### Part 6: Environment Design
- Your environment is a series of activation energy decisions
- **High agency environment**:
  - Books on the coffee table, phone in another room
  - Healthy food at eye level, junk food hidden or absent
  - Workout equipment visible and accessible
  - Desk clear and ready to work
- **Low agency environment**:
  - Phone next to bed
  - TV as room focal point
  - Snacks within arm's reach
  - Cluttered workspace requiring setup before work
- Design your space to make the right choice the easy choice

### Part 7: Decision Fatigue and Activation Energy
- Every decision drains your activation energy budget
- Morning: high activation energy available → can start hard things
- Evening: depleted → can barely choose what to watch
- Why successful people have uniforms and routines (Steve Jobs, Obama)
- **Strategy**: Make important decisions when your activation energy is highest
- **Strategy**: Reduce trivial decisions through automation

### Part 8: The Ritual Solution
- Rituals reduce activation energy through automaticity
- Your brain stops negotiating; it just executes
- Examples:
  - Coffee → desk → write (Hemingway)
  - Same pre-workout routine → body prepares automatically
  - Sunday meal prep → no weekday cooking decisions
- Build rituals around high-activation-energy activities
- The ritual becomes the activation energy; the task becomes momentum

### Part 9: When High Activation Energy Is Protective
- Some decisions should be hard to start (quitting your job, major purchases)
- Friction prevents impulsive bad decisions
- The key: intentionally design friction
- Add activation energy to bad habits (delete apps, hide junk food)
- Remove activation energy from good habits (prepare environment)

### Conclusion
- Starting is always the hardest part - this is physics, not a personal failing
- High-value actions often have high activation energy - this is why they're rare
- Your job: Reduce the activation energy for things that matter
- Make starting so easy that not starting requires more effort
- Pre-decide, remove steps, design your environment
- Once in motion, you'll stay in motion
- Agency isn't about motivation - it's about engineering the path of least resistance toward the life you want
