- How social media extracts and redirects your attention via shared, human behaviors. When we’re online we often seek communities that fit our understanding of the world. It’s uncommon to challenge ourselves regardless of how safe we feel anonymized and online. This behavior is most evident in online political discourse. Go to any social media site and you’ll see completely segmented political divisions whose only overlap is the occasional “raiding” where users from one side pile-on a post or video from the “other side”.
- Now, researchers have a better understanding of what drives this behavior and the consequences of it.
- It’s interesting to me that the researchers push the results of this study back on social media users. The research team believes that it’s our fault we seek out more flamboyant content rather than sticking to our core beliefs. You could only draw this conclusion if you weren’t frequently online. Every social media platform has an algorithm that pushes you deeper into niches and rabbit holes that suit your personality. It takes nothing more than diving into an Andrew Tate tweet for Twitter to push consistent right wing notifications on you. Hell, even if your demographic tends to fit the profile of right or left you’ll be pushed into the appropriate content holes
- And most influencers know it. They use a tactic called foot-in-the-door (FITD) technique, a psychological phenomena consistently used by sales people. The technique is simple enough, say a few statements that are easily agreeable then one more that might be more inflammatory. However, since you’ve already been primed to agree with the writer you’re more likely to agree with whatever their last statement is.
- FITD has the added benefit of offering a defense to naysayers. Imagine you tell your audience that they should take care of themselves by eating right and exercising, that getting a good education is important to, and finally that men aren’t able to reach their potential anymore. Capping it all with, “Wouldn’t you agree?”
- It puts you in a difficult position, if you say you don’t agree outright, you end up looking like a fool. How can you disagree that exercise and nutrition are important?
- Self-perception theory underlies FITD. SPT is the theory that when you agree with someone else’s request you’re likely to tell yourself that you _chose_ to agree with them rather than being convinced on the matter. In doing so, you’re more likely to change your beliefs and attitudes to keep agreeing with them. Simple persuasion goes a long way.
