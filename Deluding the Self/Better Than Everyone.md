It's never been easier to outcompete the world. Intelligence and access are no longer a barrier to success. We've reached a point where if you can dream it you can make it a reality. 

LLMs have fundamentally changed the barriers to becoming exceptional at whatever you choose to pursue. The traditional path, years of experience, finding the right mentors, following a prescribed track, has been transformed by technology that puts expertise at your fingertips.

It used to take years of work, experience, and the right track to gain an edge. You had to find the right mentors if you truly wanted to excel. Now, an LLM can give you almost everything you need. 

Two decades ago Tim Ferris suggested that the world was full of mentors ready to help you excel in whatever field you chose as long as you would take the time to reach out to them. He argued that just below the top performers were a world of athletes, performers, and businessmen who were leagues beyond our current capabilities but only a few notches below the best in the world. Yet, because they weren't well known no one reached out to them. 

He argued that their lack of fame made them accessible and far more responsive. While those at the top were overwhelmed with messages, just a few tiers below meant their names were never in the spotlight.

Their expertise was literally second to one. To a beginner their gap in skill was imperceptible, but the advice they could offer was leagues beyond what was available to the average person. 

By targeting these individuals you could quickly progress achieving better results faster and with less effort because you had someone who knew the pitfalls and new the effort that it took to get ahead. 

All those advantages Ferris urged readers to take advantage of maps directly onto todays landscape of LLMs. 

AI is instantly accessible, you don't even have to bother sending emails and hoping for a response. And while LLMs can't generate unique insights they're still a synthesis of thousands of hours of human expertise. More than enough for the average person to benefit. 

They're completely on demand and easy to leverage. There is no concept of feeling stuck. If you hit a wall you can start prompting through it. Your adviser is live 24/7 and can take on the role of any professional you can craft. 

Personally an LLMs biggest advantage is that it's not human. I'm not afraid of asking a stupid question or making a mistake because it doesn't have the capacity to judge (at least not yet).
