The first time I understood there were no adults in the room is a universal experience. It was when my parents started doing things that didn't make a lot of sense to me or pushed me in directions that didn't align with my budding view of the world.

At 25, I was working as an evaluation analyst with the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction in Washington state. This is just the department of education at the state level. Like most states we had an annual testing unit called the Washing Assessment of Student Learning. Every 4th, 7th, and 10th grader took this assessment. It helped the state and the country understand how well students were learning unified curriculum. There are plenty of good and bad reasons for tests like this, but I don't need to argue them.

Instead I want you to understand what it looks like to be an adult in the room. To sit with the folks who make decisions about your children's education. This was the second time I learned that there were no adults in the room.

### What for?
When people argue that the government or some shadow organization determines the fate of the world they argue that the purpose of this group is to keep the average man under control. 

To what ends?

What could the average person possibly offer the world? What would the average man do if they were suddenly give a tremendous amount of money? What if they had limitless intelligence at their fingertips? 

They wouldn't do anything. Well nothing of consequence. And that's a fundamental problem for those who fantasize about supremely knowledgeable shadow groups. They would serve no function. They could exist out in the open. The average man has no grand scheme for the world. He barely has a functional idea of what his next year will look like.
