<center><h1>The Death of Toxic Masculinity</h1></center>
The only way to stop a behavior is to replace it.

Woke theory making “toxic masculinity” the boogie-man of the patriarchy was destined to fail for the exact reason David highlights.

Leftists could not focus on helping men, that would put them in the limelight and that’s a taboo. The only politically correct option was to demonize. The theory read, 

> If we can make men feel enough guilt some will change into “good men”. 

Yet their was a critical failing. No one set out to define a good man. And so, the Right picked apart how men on the Left presented themselves. 

They called them effeminate, weak-willed, complacent, and ineffective. They called on the displaced man and said, “Look at what they’re saying about you. They’re saying you’re bad because you’re a man. You’re bad for wanting to eat meat, for wanting to be healthy, for wanting to have a homemaker as a wife, or pursue a career” and this message was a breath of fresh air after half a decade of insults. 

The truthiness didn’t matter. It gave a men a place to belong.

And now we’re seeing the fall-out as young men shift towards the right at every growing numbers.

Trump is President now. Any man who shifted toward the right based on their identity feels like a winner now. All over the internet are proclamations of "DEI is Dead" and "Men can be men" again. Toxic masculinity is out the door and now the left needs a new way to identify male behavior patterns they want to discourage.

This is a great reset for the Left. They have an opportunity to lick their wounds and examine what went wrong over the last decade. 

Popular commentators on the left like David Hogg and Hasan Piker can champion their ideals of a "Leftist Man" and this time make sure that eating red meat and going to the gym stay on the docket. 

This time let's call a spade a spade. Be a bit more prescriptive with our language and focus on traits and behaviors that negatively impact society while uplifting traits we'd rather see. Combat the [[Young Men and Fragility Culture|idea that men have no future]]. 

Men who care for their communities, families, and themselves rather than who has the most money. Men who hold true to their ideals even when taking a shortcut is by all measurable terms far easier. Men who keep their word. Men who support one another. Men that want to build a better future.

That last part is exactly where Trump one. Even if he never articulated how he was going to accomplish the work he told America he had a vision for a better future. A vision that benefitted the lives of the majority of Americans rather than those in niches you'd rarely see in Arizona or Nevada. 

The left has four years to get this right and the clock is ticking rapidly.
