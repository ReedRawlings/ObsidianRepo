The most expensive lie you've ever told yourself, "I'll do it tomorrow"

Every moment of every day creates a future you can analyze. Look at yourself ten-years from now based on what you do today. Are you a failure? YOU CAN PREDICT YOUR FUTURE.

“The best day to plant a tree was 20-years ago, the second best is now” is the response you need to give yourself every time you start to ruminate on what could have been.

Winners have a bias toward action.

You don’t need to “fix” yourself to start pursuing the things you want to do. Therapy is not a prerequisite to going to the gym. Healing trauma is not a pretext to starting a business. Finding yourself is not on the college admission form. Your future employer does not care if you’ve worked on yourself.
