$10,000 for misinformation? What could go wrong?

What happens when we pay $10,000 for misinformation?

X is now paying for misinformation as long as it goes viral

X is paying $10k for misinformation at the height of AI generation

Well, we all get to find out soon. Just two weeks after Nikita Bier celebrated X going viral for being the social media site to allow its user to witness murder we have a new social media experiment to watch.

Today, Bier rewarded a user an extra $10,000 dollars for creating a viral moment on X. The problem? The content was a pure misinformation. 

It's easy to argue that all memes have a bit of untruth. That their virality comes with a trade-off in truth seeking. That's fine. I see no problem with the trade-off.

My concern comes from the incentive itself. Whatever is most viral on any given day is rarely the full truth especially when it comes to internet culture. Increasing incentives here will likely warp this further.

At the same exact moment we're seeing AI generations so powerful that the untrained eye has a really difficult time telling what's real or not. We're quickly entering a post slop era. Another 6 to 12 months and AI video vs the real deal, at least in short form content, will be almost indistinguishable.

Your grandparents and parents struggle today, right now, with AI generation. There is no education on how to detect truth from lies and even if their were it would be outdated in months. 

More than anything, this is the bad timeline. We have sycophantic LLMs, teens committing suicide, the worlds largest AI consumption tools are either focused on companionship or dominating it. We could handle these individually but taken together the likelihood anything human makes it to 2100 is dwindling rapidly.

Even if this round if LLMs doesn't lead to ASI we've laid a foundation for enslavement.
