# You Don’t Need More Motivation—You Need a Better Identity

## 1. The Problem: You Don’t Really Value the Work
- Most people say they want to grow, change, achieve—but they don’t *feel* it.
- They chase motivation like a drug because they haven’t aligned the work with their *identity*.
- *Value* isn’t objective—it’s personal. If you don’t feel like the work belongs to you, you’ll abandon it.

## 2. Identity-Based Motivation: The Work Must Be “Like Me”
- **Core idea**: You’re more likely to take action when it feels like something a person *like you* would do.
- Your brain asks: *“Is this me?”*—and if the answer is no, motivation dies.
- **Superordinate goals**: goals that reflect who you *are* or *want to be* (e.g., “I’m a disciplined man,” “I’m the kind of person who builds things that last”).
- When your goals are identity-driven, value is *felt*, not forced.

## 3. Cognitive Dissonance: Let Your Actions Rewire Your Identity
- When you act in ways that don’t match your current identity, you feel discomfort (dissonance).
- But here’s the twist: *That’s not a problem—it’s leverage*.
- You can either:
  1. Quit the behavior to preserve the old identity,
  2. Or adopt the new identity to justify the action.
- This is how small acts of discipline or courage create a new self-concept.
- **Action precedes transformation**.

## 4. Why Most People Don’t Value the Work
- They’re stuck in shallow goals—tasks that don’t serve a bigger purpose.
- They’re doing things that belong to someone else’s agenda, not their own.
- They’ve never *named* who they want to become—so they can’t align daily actions with that vision.
- No identity = no anchor = no enduring value.

## 5. How to Make Value Stick
- **Craft a superordinate goal**: Not “go to the gym” but “become the kind of man who honors his body and sharpens his mind.”
- **Act like the future you**: Do one thing today that your aspirational self would do.
- **Use friction as proof**: When it’s hard, remind yourself—that’s the dissonance working *for* you. You’re upgrading your identity.

## 6. Conclusion: Want to Stay Consistent? Change Who You Are
- You don’t need more motivation—you need a clear vision of who you are becoming.
- And you need to act like it before you believe it..
