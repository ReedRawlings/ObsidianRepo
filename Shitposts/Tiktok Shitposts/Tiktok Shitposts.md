It’s rare to meet people who prioritize ambition over comfort. If that’s you, I’m sad to say you’ll have just as hard a time finding someone who appreciates that trait.

All through Bidens term we heard "Weak men create hard times" bullshit from incels and the alt-right. The moment a weak man gets into office our country implodes and none of them have anything to say now.


Stop trying to cheat health. You don’t need 20 supplements, a strict diet, and some dude-perfect workout. Go to the gym, lift weights, every day.

Psychology tells us that when we’re experiencing resistance, the best thing to do is name it, confront the feeling, and work through the problem

~~What are we going to do with all the young men who’ve literally gambled their lives away and have no education at the same time AGI takes over and there are no jobs left for them?~~

- ~~Obviously gambling addiction is on the rise, look at these sports betting revenues, obviously men doing this, obviously not going to opt in getting help. Going to be an interesting back half of the decade~~
- [https://www.americangaming.org/resources/state-of-the-states-2024/](https://www.americangaming.org/resources/state-of-the-states-2024/) - It’s not just the rise in gambling, it’s how pervasive it is with young men. None of my over 30 friends gamble. All of my coworkers under 27 do.


Mind-numbing work, a soulless job, it makes you crave that same type of entertainment. Your brain has no space for complexity.

The worst thing you can do for your mental state is worrying about missed opportunities. You have to put those things in the past where they belong or they eat you up

High agency people have one quality in common. It’s not just working hard, or wanting more out of live - they hold themselves accountable.

You spend hours gaming because you care about the outcome and have passion for your efforts. If you can find that attitude in other parts of your life you can do anything.

Men need to grow up. Less video games, no collecting toys, the obsession with fandoms needs to stop.

In 2025 we are done being wishy washy. We are taking a stand for the things we believe in. We’re going to be passionate and intentional and confident.

Men are neurologically (the brain) wired for addictive traits. This is why you see men develop addictions to drugs, gambling, gaming, or whatever risky behavior at higher rates.

- **Dopamine Receptor Density**: Studies using neuroimaging techniques (e.g., PET scans) have found that males tend to have higher dopamine receptor density in certain brain regions, such as the **striatum**, which is part of the brain's reward circuitry. Higher receptor density may make males more responsive to dopamine release, increasing their sensitivity to rewarding stimuli.
- **Dopamine Sensitivity**: Males also appear to have greater dopamine release in response to certain stimuli, such as drugs or gambling. This heightened sensitivity can make intense, momentary pleasures more reinforcing and increase the likelihood of addictive behaviors.

I mean… he’s not wrong

Oh you were a gifted kid? Okay sure, your failure as an adult is definitely because you were a grade ahead of the other kids.

Visual Series on the Psychology of Sales (part 1)
1. 15M in sales has taught me one simple lesson. And I’ll carry it with me forever. **You dont get what you dont ask for**.
2. Buyer back out of purchases for the same reasons we back out of our goals
3. Keeping the status quo is more likely than taking action. People trust the devil they know over uncertain outcomes.
4. A persons identity matters more than the product itself
5. People say many things and mean very few of them. 

Sales Lessons That Made Me Better at Life

- You're often de-risking a decision not just selling a product
- I am more therapist with a quota than persuasive mastermind
- You're selling to a multi-layered identity not a uniform
- Trust is the critical factor

Stop trying to hack your productivity and start holding yourself accountable.

It’s never been this easy to get rich and for that exact reason so many of you won’t. You’ll get scammed by others, give up too early, and fail to put in the effort required because so many around you will be "making it"
