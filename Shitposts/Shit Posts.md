Long form ideas

- Destroy the Past, Create the Future
    - People who can’t focus do one of three things on a loop, ruminate about the past, daydream or dread the future, and numb the present
    - These are the characteristics of an NPC. Someone who can’t live in the moment with themselves.
    - These are people who squander their lives
    - These are the people who could so easily take back control of their lives and pursue their dreams that it cause me psychic pain to think how close they are to escape
    
- Female Validation Matters too Much to Men
    - When you seek female validation you will push it further away from you. Women do not want to pursue you. They do not want to validate you. Needing validation is inherently feminine. Big Dick Energy does not need validation. BDE has direction. It is supportive. It understand what needs to be done and does it.
    - If your first step towards finding a mate is asking for them to validate you you’ve violated everything between a man and a woman.
    - If you look in the mirror and see yourself as attractive, women will feel the same about you. It might not be the exact woman you want, but it will work to your advantage.
    - Women can smell desperation. I’ve witnessed it first hand after a terrible break up. I wanted to be with someone. I wanted to get over the relationship. So many women took pity on me. I was back to being a little boy in their eyes. They assumed the role of care taker because that’s what I put out into the world.
    - Eventually I assumed the role of a man again. Brimming with confidence simply for existing. Suddenly I didn’t need a woman in my life and it was so much easier to start conversations with them in ways that put us on the same level.
- When men hang out together they are truly “with the boys”. Women always gawk at the fact that men’s plans are last minute, hastily put together, always out to the same default bar they go to, and no real conversation happens. Of course! We’re tired of making decisions and being responsible. We get a few hours every few weeks to stop being men and be kids again. This is therapy for men. It’s why all male spaces are important.

    - How content will change over time (steal idea don’t quote tweet)
- Stop Reading About the Thing and Do It Instead
- “Savior Mode” - How thinking of the past and rehearsing the future put us on a pedestal that prevents the real work from happening.
    - Holding grudges and imagining “winning” instead of becoming a winner

- Microplastics in the Balls
    - Horrible news everyone, the microplastics in your balls are there to stay. The good news? You could prevent more from entering.
    - Microplastics are primarily a water based issue.
    - The easiest thing to do, (today), stop using plastic. No more plastic water bottles. Metal or glass bottles are the way to go. I’ve never been to a coffee shop that won’t let me use my own container and if they did I’d tell them where to stick it.
    - Stop microwaving in plastic containers. Get some glass storage containers instead. Every time you heat plastic containers (microwave or washing) they leak microplastics and these go directly into any food you store in them.
    - If possible, replace all your non-stick and plastic work ware with glass, metal, or wood. This includes your cutting boards!
    - Filter your water or better yet, boil it first. A few recent studies show that boiling and then filtering your water can reduce 90% of microplastics present in tap water.
    - Get an air purifier or filtration system. Make sure your home air filter is clean! These are simple steps to take and you could have them done by this weekend. You don’t even need a particularly powerful air purifier to capture large microplastics.
    - Recent rise in athleisure it almost 100% made of synthetic materials which shed microplastics when washed. Recent studies also show that sweating and rubbing against synthetic materials can cause your body to absorb microplastics through the skin. Organic materials aren’t specifically better (they still release microfibers, but those will affect your body different from microplastics)
    - Avoid fatty meats. Forever chemicals and pollutants tend to stick to fatty tissue better than muscle. You can still eat red meat but stop eating the fatty bits.
    - Avoid predator meals (mostly fish) as they concentrate forever chemicals in their body.
    - Plastic containers get a lot of the flack for being a microplastics pollutants, but synthetic fabrics (like the clothes you’re wearing right now) are the worst offenders.
    - Studies are still ongoing but its clear microplastics impact our endocrine system
    - Don’t microwave food in plastic materials, don’t drink from plastic water bottles, don’t use plastic utensils even while cooking (glass, wood, metal), get a HEPA air filter to capture particles in the air, eliminate plastic in your clothing where possible. Most activewear is majority synthetic or 100% synthetic especially athleisure. Higher food chain animals have a greater chance of containing microplastics; avoid larger fish. Take your shoes off; dust and dirt track in microfibers and bacteria. Filter the water you consumer. Increase your fiber intake. Buying organic may help, at least to reduce pesticides, but it’s still likely microplastics have entered all crops, reduce your fat from meat intake. Chemicals settle in fatty tissues over muscles. You can still eat red meat, but avoid the fatty pieces. Remove nonstick pans. Boil tap water before drinking it.
    - Can we reduce plastics in our body? One small study from Australia found that donating blood or plasma seems to reduce the level of PFAS in the body. Chance that increasing fiber-rich foods will reduce the impact of accumulation (they will not reduce microplastics already in the body). Possible exercise and specifically sweating can reduce microplastics, but unlikely to have any real impact.

- There has never been a better time to win
