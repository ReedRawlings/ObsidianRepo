Suicide rates higher for black pill males or trans men?

---
I love to tell people I’m doing nothing, but nothing is always sitting on my phone and feeling slightly bad about myself.

---
Women don't want to be your parents. You need to take the leadership role.

---
Black pilled men have to be the easiest group to milk for cash after left-leaning women.

I’ve never forced anyone to work in the cobalt mines but if it meant I wouldn’t get a new iphone this year you can bet your ass I would.

---
You want to touch tips? No?

Then what are we even doing…

---
Incels as a movement is interesting. Low T behavior, external locus of control, low agency, poor self-worth. Have to imagine suicide rates are incredibly high.

But I have to wonder who’s out there creating the content. Clearly some incel influencers cranking out misogynist blogs and videos.

Maybe it’s easy to gather a bunch of low agency men together and spoon feed them a singular worldview rather than lift them up

---
Introverts need to have high agency. They are at the disadvantage of needing to create opportunities for themselves.

Extroverts go to parties or organize events and people think they have unique skills and want to spend more time with them.

My first adult job came from a weekend trip on a farm dropping acid and listening to music.

Sent an email to one of my favorite authors and got the best life advice I’d ever received a few hours later.

---

I’m in favor of criminalizing weed and sports gambling again. Too many young men are forever off the path because of one of these.

We already had to contend with sports addicts but the fact they can make money from their knowledge is one-shotting too many of my brothers. At least the analytical skills some of them gain have value in the real world.

Weed, however, just drop it off the face of the Earth. Medical marijuana is completely fine, but I shouldn’t be able to buy any substance that takes me offline for 4-6 hours at a time.

---

~~Spending time worrying about the consequences of your actions is low T behavior.~~

---

~~This is true for everyone who believes it and false for everyone else~~

~~Friend is getting divorced because her husband won’t stop trying to get rich quick in crypto (his other habits suffer from this).~~

~~I need all of you not to let your day jobs and relationships suffer just because you missed a few 100X’s not staring at the computer 24/7. We already have a birthrate problem and this woman has now wasted her early 20’s on a failson rather than raising children.~~

---

People who keep their spirits young can outcompete anyone, no matter their age or natural talent. Your ambition rules everything you do and that only fades if you let it.

---

Desperation reeks. Women can smell it miles away. It causes them to feel violently ill. It’s revolting.

If you’re pursuing women in this state you must stop. No pussy is worth having people look at you in disgust and the pity sex will only make you feel worse.

Trying out for an audition, interviewing for a job, a sales pitch, dating - all the same. You have no shot.

---

Therapy speak is a cancer. You’re not unique because you didn’t enjoy school. You don’t have ADHD because your email job doesn’t bring you profound joy.

Do you think early farmers loved breaking their backs every day? No, they needed to eat just like you do. A lot of life sucks and it’s fucking boring, but you don’t need drugs and a complex to get through it you can just have hobbies and relationships that enrich your life instead.

---

Low agency, external locus of control, neurotic, whatever you want to call it. These people are miserable to be around. Their lives are filled with “unlucky” moments. They have no control over what happens to them (they do) and they will try to psyop you into thinking the same.

The worst thing that can happen for these people is that they realize their experiences are largely their own fault.

~~Fear might be the mind killer, but distraction kills the soul. And we have so much more distraction to contend with.~~

The second amendment is great because it gives men who can’t find the clitoris a way to remove themselves from the gene pool.

---
~~You are not the person you wish to be because you refuse to act.~~

---
If you accept that fact you’re a fucking idiot and start asking questions instead of feeling anxiety over what could happen your life will improve ten-fold.

---

~~There was a period after 2016 where you’d be mocked tremendously for saying, “I usually get what I ask for”, by people who have never tried it.~~

~~I don’t know if those people suddenly started trying it, but I’m glad we nuked that mindset from the collective conscious.~~

~~It is not privilege that makes this true, but your own cognition trying to grok your internal desires with the outside world and acting in a way that will make them align~~.

---

I wonder if the desire to get rich quick was this bad during the gold rush. I can’t imagine so. No apps to downloads. No concept of turning an hours wage into the next 100X in less time than it took to earn it.

---

You can smell the stench of a man who believes in getting rich quick.

---

It’s imperative we start laughing at men who complain about dating app statistics. Get off the apps and head outside. The number of women I see out compared to men is at an all-time high.

Women looking for relationships are forced to use apps because that’s where men exist. You have a massive competitive advantage walking about to women outside. Talk to your high-mid coworkers about this. No one is hitting on them in public.

---

My wife texted me “okay, have fun” and I thought that was so kind. She didn’t even waste my time with a long text and let me get right back to drinking with the boys.

---

I’ve seen this type of defeatism in two of my friends. One is self-employed and this didn’t knock him until his early 30’s. Very vibrant man before that, athletic, self-made. Then realized he hit a physical wall and it was like the wind was taken from him.  
  
The other just turned 25 and realized his B2B SaaS job was worthless (insomnia induced not ayahuasca).  
  
It doesn’t seem like either of them will get their feet back under them. Not sure what would do it except helping to raise the next generation. When the self-made man interacts with his niece and nephews the light comes back, but he doesn’t believe it.

While I continue to see arguments for AI content creators taking over because they’ll be able to “react” at light speed to events. In the same vein, I know with certainty that authentic voices and curators will make a massive comeback as people strive for communities and in-groups that match their tastes and give them real human interaction.

There is a file on you somewhere that says your inability to focus and lack of volition mean you pose no threat.

How to make your girlfriend feel special:

- Ask if she’s on a diet because she looks smaller
- tell her you like how in touch she is with her masculine side
- tell her you love how confident she is despite her weight
- tell her you think her extra love handles are SO cute
- tell her you love how she’s not insecure that all her friends wear their makeup better

Waiting in line at the self-checkout while people struggle to figure out how to scan their shit is my personal hell

---

~~Truth of it is, if you get healthy today and start focusing on yourself and your community you could still live a happy life, but lets be real you will keep scrolling social media instead~~.

---

Some of ya’ll will just need to take what you can get. Dating apps were not made for men who look like you. Start chatting up your coworkers and pray they can introduce you to a looks match.

---

If you want to get ahead keep thinking. Spend as much time as possible stuck in your thoughts. Your thoughts are a safe place where you can be a hero without putting any work in. And tomorrow? When you wake up and realize you’ve wasted another day, just keep thinking about how you can get to work tomorrow.

---

There’s a certain amount of brainrot where your mind just shuts down completely. You’ll see it when you talk to coworkers, you see it in how people post, and respond to social media. People self-selecting into intellectual castes

---

If you spent just 50% of the time you waste fantasizing little scenarios in your head on something productive. You’d be unstoppable.

---

Your posting says a lot about your **Physiognomy**

---

Men will cope endlessly rather than deal with theirs issues.

---

The worlds wants you passive. The corporate world wants a good team-player, the government wants a docile flock, schools want a bright, quiet pupil. ADHD diagnosis have been on the rise for decades and they’ll continue to expand to ensure the children stay quiet and in line.

---

~~Is it still body dysmorphia if I'm happy with the end result?~~

---

Passive men should give you the ick. Unable to talk about their emotions and desires. Robots at work. Obsessed with consumption and providing nothing to the world.

The mental state of a child.

---

Some women want a passive man if they want a man at all; the church wants a tamed man—they are called priests; the university wants a domesticated man—they are called tenure-track people; the corporation wants a team-worker, and so on.  
Note: Its sensible, even good that these things are wanted from society, but they are not all what you should want for yourself.

Type of guy so in love with self-shame he passes from corpo slave to addict just to ensure he'll never have to take control of his life.

Wealthy men have mid wives so they're not constantly distracted

You're optimizing for the wrong prize. Marry a 7 you can always fuck 10s on the weekend

This seems to me to be the position that lonely men are in online. People will tell them they’re evil misogynist rapists – as the articles above did – no matter what. In what is apparently shocking news to a lot of people, this makes them hurt and angry. As someone currently working on learning psychotherapy, I can confidently say that receiving a constant stream of hatred and put-downs throughout your most formative years can really screw you up. And so these people try to lash out at the people who are doing it to them, secure in the knowledge that there’s no room left for people to hate them even more  
  
An analysis of the psychometric Big Five consistently find that high levels of disagreeableness predict high sexual success in both men and women  

---

Of course passive, luke warm, milquetoast, can't follow through boys don't get laid.  
What do they offer their partners?  
What do you want for dinner? Idk w/e.What do you want to do this weekend? Whatever you want I'm fine with. When do you want to settle down? Eh, when it feels right.  
The endless non-answer has to be the most unattractive thing a man can embody. It's a type of immaturity that screams, "my mother coddled me too much

Leg Day? Nice try liberals, you won't turn me into a thick femboy

Men are the more dramatic of the sexes. The 2.3M members of LiveStreamFails are all failsons addicted to watching drama unfold.

Likeability is a jail cell you’re addicted to living in. You don’t have to give a shit about peoples opinions if you know you’re good enough.

Anime has too many diverse, healthy representations of masculinity to go mainstream. They’d never let it happen.

Getting your shit together requires a level of honesty you’re not comfortable with yet. There’s nothing easy about realizing you’re the one that’s been holding yourself back your whole life.

If you identify with this image you desperately need to make an identity for yourself. You are an NPC.

Accepting your body for the way it looks stops being beneficial once you realize other people might want to see it.

---

You don’t have to fix your partners problems. Men are addicted to fixing problems because, in the rare instances we ask for help, what we want is someone to help us fix the problem. Women take a social approach to sharing their issues and would frequently prefer acknowledgement.

---

Poverty mindset is so destructive.  
  
The moment you hit that six-figure threshold you’ll do anything to keep it. You’ll save every penny you can. You start to go miser mode. You lose the hunger you had and start to develop a hoarding mindset. The same $600 it costs to replace your tires every four years will still hit your mental at 4-figures as six.  
  
You expend mental energy on meaningless tasks when you can simply solve them with money.  

---

If your problem can be solved with money you have, you don’t have a problem.

You're not really busy you cunt. You're a slave to some corpo overlord. Your job, your hobbies, your desires. They aren't real. Society thrust them on you

If you want to be successful, you just need others to perceive you as being successful and they’ll start to offer you opportunities and ideas.

The best thing you can do for your cult is pit them against the ‘others’

---

Now that energy or "vibes" are memetic you can leverage them in your cult. If you do small things to adjust your energy you’ll notice a change in your own X.  
Those “small things” can be whatever product you’re selling and X is whatever universally agreed upon ‘good thing_™’_ you’re improving that’s likely just correlated with confidence and positivity.

Looking to start a new religion. I’m not going to answer the unanswerable though, I’m just going to tell folks how they can get laid, make money, and find love. Like, follow, and subscribe for more

I don’t share facts. I spread _ideas_.

You need to release yourself from caring about all the stupid shit in the world  
it wnt change anything for you it simply becomes a burden you force yourself to care about.  
  
imagine the man obsessed with owning a Ferrari. He looks at pictures he defends his desires against those who call it dumb he dreams of his future car he wastes time envying those who have one while simultaneously taking advice from influencers who have one because he thinks its a valid sign of success  
  
all of this is wasted time and energy because he self-selected into an out group  
he'd be far better served obsessing over the means to achieve his goals

Damn, for the first time in your genetic lineage, you’re free to invent your own work and realize the full benefits of your productivity through sheer motivation and willpower and you’re stuck doing this.

My wife is making dinner so passive aggressively.

The passive man may not say what he wants, and the girlfriend or wife has to guess it. As a compensation for passivity at home, he may go into robot production at work, but that isn’t really what he wants either. -

I’m so depressed I can’t even blink

Imagine what you would have turned out like if both your parents loved you unconditionally.

When their are too many rubes about, the world must act to take advantage of them. NFTs and meme-stocks were the most recent examples. Those in the know made a killing while the rest of the world could only ask, “how can anyone be this retarded?”

Oh, you’re breaking up with me?  
  
Well now I’m going to do all those things you wanted for me while we were dating just to spite you and then when I’m not satisfied with myself I’ll use them as a reason we should get back together long after the fact.  
  
Thanks for making me 10x the man 😏

The only shame that matters is being poor. You think, if I just had more money everything would be solved. And so, every problem becomes a financial problem. Every humiliation an indictment of financial status over anything else.

there is no limit to what I can do. I outwork you while putting in less hours and less effort. you’re a child. you peaked in middle school

Simple living has a air of mysticism to it because so may people live a life of instant gratification, but every person who thinks they’ll “retire to the farm” is lying to themselves. They’ll never quit the dopamine drip.
