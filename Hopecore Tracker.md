| You cant plan for every possible outcome, but you can prepare yourself to fail. Recognize your control and respond to setbacks for the inconvenience they are.                                                                                                                                                      |        |            |          |

Choose safety and end up with those who chose risk and failed.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |        |            |          |
| Lasting change comes from incremental improvement not overnight success                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |        |            |          |
