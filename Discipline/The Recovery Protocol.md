## Brief Outline

### Introduction
- Everyone breaks habits. The difference is how quickly they recover
- The shame spiral: how one missed day becomes one missed month
- Recovery speed matters more than perfection

### Part 1: Slip vs. Relapse - Know the Difference
- **Slip**: Single instance, context-specific (travel, illness, emergency)
- **Relapse**: Pattern breakdown, multiple missed instances, system failure
- Why this distinction matters for your response

### Part 2: The Immediate Recovery Protocol (for Slips)
- **Hour 1**: Acknowledge without judgment - "I skipped the gym, that happened"
- **Hour 24**: Identify the cause - was it the system or an anomaly?
- **Hour 48**: Resume immediately, no waiting for Monday/next month
- The "next legal move" - what's the smallest action you can take right now?

### Part 3: The System Audit (for Relapses)
- If you've missed 3+ times, the system failed, not you
- Questions to ask: What friction appeared? What changed in environment?
- Adjusting the system rather than "trying harder"

### Part 4: Self-Compassion as Strategy (Not Weakness)
- Research on self-compassion and behavior change
- Harsh self-criticism activates threat response, shuts down prefrontal cortex
- Self-compassion keeps you in problem-solving mode
- The difference between self-compassion and self-indulgence

### Part 5: Prevention Strategies
- Building "if-then" plans for known obstacles
- The planned break vs. the unplanned slip
- Weekly reviews to catch patterns early

### Conclusion
- Discipline isn't about never failing, it's about failing forward
- Master the recovery protocol and you become unstoppable
- Every slip is data for improving your system
