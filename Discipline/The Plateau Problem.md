- The difference between true plateaus and measurement issues
- Adjusting systems vs. doubling down on effort
- Process metrics vs. outcome metrics

## Article Ideas
- "The plateau is not the problem, your response to it is"
- Why linear progress is a myth
- How to tell if you're actually stuck or just measuring wrong
- The compound curve: invisible progress before breakthrough
- When to pivot vs. when to persist

## Article Ideas (continued)
- What elite performers do during plateaus
- The danger of "trying harder" when systems are the issue

## Brief Outline

### Introduction
- The universal experience: rapid initial progress, then... nothing
- The emotional response: frustration, doubt, quitting
- Plateaus are features, not bugs, of skill development

### Part 1: Why Plateaus Are Normal
- The learning curve is never linear (S-curves, power law)
- Newbie gains vs. intermediate grind
- Neurological adaptation: your brain is consolidating, not stalling
- The compound curve: "nothing, nothing, nothing, EVERYTHING"
- Examples: language learning, fitness, skill development

### Part 2: True Plateau vs. Measurement Problems
- **Measurement Problem**: Wrong metrics, unrealistic timeframe
- **True Plateau**: Legitimate ceiling with current approach
- Questions to diagnose: What am I measuring? Over what timeframe?
- Leading indicators vs. lagging indicators
- Example: Scale weight vs. body composition, strength, energy levels

### Part 3: Process Metrics vs. Outcome Metrics
- **Outcome**: Weight lost, money earned, skill level
- **Process**: Days trained, hours practiced, consistency maintained
- Why process metrics matter more during plateaus
- You control inputs, not outputs
- Trusting the process when results lag

### Part 4: When to Adjust Your System
- Signs your system needs updating:
  - Consistently can't execute the plan
  - No progress despite perfect execution for 3+ months
  - External circumstances changed (job, living situation, etc.)
- What to adjust: frequency, intensity, duration, method
- A/B testing one variable at a time

### Part 5: When to Double Down (Not Give Up)
- The plateau right before breakthrough is the hardest
- The "dip" (Seth Godin): temporary setback before mastery
- Stories of people who quit right before success
- How to tell if you're in a dip vs. a dead end

### Part 6: The Psychological Game
- Reframing: plateaus as consolidation periods
- Celebrating process wins when outcome wins disappear
- The long-term view: zoom out to see progress
- Comparison trap: comparing your middle to someone else's highlight

### Conclusion
- Plateaus separate those who succeed from those who quit
- Adjust your system or your metrics, not your commitment
- Progress is happening even when invisible
- The plateau is where character is built
