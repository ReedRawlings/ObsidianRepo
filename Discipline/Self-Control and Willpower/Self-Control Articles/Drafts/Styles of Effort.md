Self-control (Trait Self-control): Pre-planned behaviors organized around either resisting temptation (if-then plans) or enabling the avoidance of temptation. “All day I told myself I wouldn’t get dessert at the restaurant” OR “I told my wife to not let me get a dessert menu so I could avoid the temptation”

Conscientiousness: Behavior consistent with a persons long-term goals and success. May include a variety of traits and beliefs; grit, compassion, locus of control. “I don’t eat dessert at restaurants.

Habit: Consistent behaviors that may or may not align with an individuals desired state of being
