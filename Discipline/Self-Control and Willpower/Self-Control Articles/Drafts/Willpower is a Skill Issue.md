- Willpower is a skill and thus the lack of it is a skill issue. We’ve proven this countless times over the decades with children ranging from toddlers to young adults.
- The major skill issue is your belief in yourself. Or, how you feel any individuals view of willpower.
- This is true of all traits. If you view intelligence, work ethic, willpower, kindness as fixed you will view your own ability to increase (or decrease) any trait as impossible. You need to think of every characteristic as a skill and your inability to affect them as a skill issue.
- A 2019 study read a storybook to children. That main character struggled with waiting, but eventually found it energizing to exercise patience. They learned that patience could lead to better outcomes.
- The students who listened to this book over the control were more likely to delay gratification. Even more so, they came up with their own strategies to support their delay of gratification.
- In previous studies, students were taught strategies to help them delay gratification which added a further forcing mechanisms into the process.
- Two major outcomes here.
    - One it may be easier than previously thought to teach students how to self-regulate. Rather than direct lessons on self-control, exposing them to stories, characters, and themes that relate to self-regulation may be enough to help them learn about and engage in tendencies that will make their life easier.
    - Two, delivery of these strategies can be incredibly cheap. Digital books, short-form content, video lessons, or even interactions with purpose built LLMs kids can chat with can deliver these messages in bulk during developmental periods.
