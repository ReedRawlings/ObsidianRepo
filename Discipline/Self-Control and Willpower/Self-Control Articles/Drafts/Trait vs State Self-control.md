“Put the phone down”, “get to work”, “lock in” “just do it”,, this is what you might hear scrolling Instagram or watching Tiktok. These are influencers phrases meant to motivate you into action, but they seldom have the desired effect.

Each of these phrases focuses on at-the-moment choices rather than restructuring your habits to align with long-term goals. While they’re functional adages for boosting motivation, they are unlikely to work over the long-term.

This is the difference between trait and state self-control.

Trait Self-control: Grit, conscientiousness, delayed gratification. Our ability to work diligently toward our goals regardless of the hardships we face.

State Self-control: Willpower, volition, locking in. Our ability to resist momentary temptations.

There’s one influencer today who embodies and preaches a version of trait self-control; David Goggins. “Who’s going to carry the boats” is easier associated with becoming a person who will take action, lead, do the hard work as opposed to more motivation aligned influencers who focus on momentary effort.

*Be good to find examples of influencers focused on momentary changes

Self-help influencers today are far behind the times in terms of research on what actually makes us productive and for good reason. They don’t want you to be successful. Like cigarette companies, the longer they can keep you addicted the more successful they’ll be.

These nuances in language are impactful! If you believe the way you should be approaching self-improvement and pursuing a better life centers on resisting temptations you will likely fail.

Success in the short-term is common. It’s possible for us to resist temptations and create strategies that help guide us toward the right actions, but continually needing to execute on these strategies is a drain on mental resources.

Successful individuals do not resist temptation, they don’t face it at all. There are no cookies in the cookie jar. They do not have gambling apps on their phone they need to stop themselves from opening. Their homes aren’t filled with whatever drugs they know are fun, but prevent them from focusing on their work.

They are not perpetually locked in, they are simply living lives that look the way.

Who do you think is more likely to keep a fitness goal, the person who views fitness as a way of living their best life or the one who has to “lock in” every day forcing themselves to get up and go to the gym?

  

Trait self-control may be understood as never having had to exert state self-control at all.

## Claude Version

# Willpower Isn't Enough

"Put the phone down." "Get to work." "Lock in." "Just do it."

Scroll through social media, and you'll find these motivational mantras everywhere. They're meant to spark action, to push you toward productivity. But there's a fundamental problem with these phrases: they're built on a flawed understanding of how lasting behavior change works.

## The Two Faces of Self-Control

What influencers miss is the distinction between two types of self-control:

**State Self-Control** is what most people think of as willpower—the moment-by-moment battle against temptation. It's putting down the phone, resisting the cookie, or forcing yourself to hit the gym. It's exhausting, and more importantly, it's unsustainable.

**Trait Self-Control** is different. It's not about fighting temptation; it's about building a life where temptation rarely exists. It's about developing habits, routines, and environments that naturally align with your goals. People with high trait self-control don't constantly resist cookies—they don't keep cookies in their house.

## The Social Media Trap

Today's self-help landscape is dominated by influencers selling state self-control strategies. Whether it’s malicious or ignorance, they benefit from selling you state self-control strategies. Because if you succeed in building genuine trait self-control, you won't need their daily motivation fixes anymore.

There are exceptions. Take David Goggins, whose famous "Who's going to carry the boats?" message isn't about momentary willpower. It's about becoming someone who naturally takes action, who leads, who does the hard work not through constant internal struggle but through transformed identity.

## The Path to Lasting Change

Consider two people starting a fitness journey:

1. Person A "locks in" every morning, fighting an internal battle to get to the gym, requiring constant motivation and willpower.
2. Person B has restructured their life around fitness—they go to bed early, keep their gym clothes ready, and have workout buddies waiting for them. Going to the gym isn't a daily struggle; it's just what they do. They carry the boats.

  

Who do you think will still be working out a year from now?

## The Paradox

Here's the fascinating paradox: The people who appear to have the most self-control often exert the least willpower in their daily lives. They're not constantly fighting temptations—they've built lives where those temptations rarely surface.

This is what trait self-control really means. It's not about having superhuman willpower. It's about:

- Creating environments that support your goals
- Building routines that make good choices automatic
- Developing habits that eliminate the need for constant decision-making
- Surrounding yourself with people who share your values

The next time you feel tempted to "lock in", ask yourself: Instead of trying to win this moment of temptation, how could I restructure my environment to avoid this temptation altogether?

Pursuing your goals isn't about fighting harder—it's about fighting less. It's about building a life where the right choices are the easy choices, where good habits are just the way things are done.
