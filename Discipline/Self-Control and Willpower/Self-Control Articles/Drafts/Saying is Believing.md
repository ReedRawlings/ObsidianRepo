Students who internalize specific belief systems about themselves or their situations can change their views of the world by stating opposing beliefs and internalizing those beliefs through restatement. Low-cost therapy that helps people reframe their worldview.

This takes advantage of cognitive dissonance where a person states a belief opposite of their own, but once spoken and especially shared with peers, the speaker starts to update their beliefs to match their statements.

  

How does it work?

The Saying-is-Believing Effect is a psychological phenomenon that refers to the process by which people come to believe their own messages, especially after conveying them to others. This is a form of cognitive dissonance where, after expressing a statement or opinion, individuals adjust their beliefs to be consistent with the message they’ve delivered. This effect helps individuals maintain internal consistency, which is essential for mental equilibrium and a sense of self-coherence

Mechanisms:

- Thinking deeply about their statements
- Connect the message to specific practices
    - Tying your statements to spoken goals
    - Write messages to future students about how they applied their beliefes
- Framing the process as positive rather than stigmatizing
    - Sharing your message with others is an act of community, increasing the stickiness of the message
    - Having a positive impact on your peers improves your association with the behavior

  

The Role of Cognitive Dissonance

Research on cognitive dissonance shows that individuals are motivated to align their attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors due to feelings of discomfort when those aspects are not psychologically consistent with one another (Festinger & Carlsmith, [1959](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-022-02782-z#ref-CR20); Festinger, [1957](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-022-02782-z#ref-CR18), [1962](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-022-02782-z#ref-CR19)). That is, synchronic feelings are important for an individual’s life (Russo-Netzer & Icekson, [2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-022-02782-z#ref-CR43)). However, implicit in the saying-is-believing effect line of reasoning is the assumption that participants in the intervention have similar experiences of dissonance. Namely, all participants in the intervention experience the intended cognitive dissonance

Does it work?

Some have confirmed that, as intended, students in the intervention conditions are engaging more with the content by writing more (Harackiewicz et al., [2016](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-022-02782-z#ref-CR26)), writing about the content with more personal focus (“I” and “you” pronouns), and referencing social processes (Harackiewicz et al., [2016](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-022-02782-z#ref-CR26); Hecht et al., [2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-022-02782-z#ref-CR29); Priniski et al., [2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-022-02782-z#ref-CR41)). Other than these, there are few studies that thoroughly analyze the extent to which students are engaging with the intended message through saying-is-believing exercises.

  

A person can internalize a message by, seeing others in similar situations succeeding, writing about the content using personal experiences or through a lens that identifies themselves as the main character, engaging with the content more frequently,

  

  

Quotes

Students who listen to, but do not internalize the message, would then not be expected to translate the experience into psychological and behavioral changes.
