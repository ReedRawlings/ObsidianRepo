The effects of ego depletion are likely related to the difficulty of the first task and our willingness to take on additional difficult work given a variety of choices.

My major question, given an initial demanding task does work on a subsequent demanding task diminish? Or, is it simply that we choose to give ourselves a break because that feels natural/fair/balanced.

The paper, _[Do People Avoid Mental Effort after Facing a Highly Demanding Task](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/550b09eae4b0147d03eda40d/t/6089c015bb3d05355079f602/1619640361848/Do-People-Avoid-Mental-Effort-After-Facing-a-Highly-Demanding-Task.pdf),_ attempts to give credence to the idea of Ego Depletion. If you’re unfamiliar Ego Depletion argues that after exerting self-control you’re less likely to exert it again. Initially this was thought to be caused by brain chemistry, but over time we’ve well proven that can’t be the case and now look for other reasons.

This paper argues that you are less likely to choose a demanding task after having just completed one.

If you think about this from your own perspective, I suspect you’ll agree with this idea. When we work hard, we feel as though we deserve a break. Our days, weeks, months, are even structured this way. Work for 10 hours, rest for 14. Work for 5 days, rest for 2. Work for 11 months, vacation for 1. Work for 60 years, rest until the end of your life.

A balance of effort is coded into our lives and that seeps into other activities. You may feel more inclined to have a drink and pizza after helping someone move. A particularly difficult day deserves a sweet treat.

The research backs this up. In studies, we’re more likely to choose easier tasks after being given demanding ones.

But, how can we use this to our advantage?

First, identify the things that will truly energize you and enable you to get back to your difficult work. The vast majority waste away scrolling social media, often for hours at a time. Is that truly what rewards you? Or would a walk outside make you more energized? Listening to part of a podcast or reading a book?

Second, understand how long of a break you need before getting back on task. If you enjoy the hard work, but find it mentally difficult a 20-minute reset might be more than enough. If the works not by choice, maybe handed down by your manager, a longer break might be in order.

Finally, recognize how wide spread this phenomena is. It’s truly coded into our being. To outcompete the world, recognize the fact that we all need to recharge, but take control of how that looks. You could be spending far more time locking in than zoning out
