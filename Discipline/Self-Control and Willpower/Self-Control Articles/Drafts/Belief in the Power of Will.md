Can you exert willpower endlessly or do you view it as a finite resource you need to recharge? (need to find a better question)

Your answer could have a massive impact on how readily you’re able to self-regulate.

In 2007, Roy Baumeister introduced the strength mode of self-control. An idea that we only had a limited amount of energy we could devote to self-control before we exhaust it.

This theory _feels_ right. After you work you’re more inclined to want to take a break or do something easier to compensate. But, follow-on research could never prove this behavior. Psychologists also had to contend with individuals who could seemingly work without rest or constantly exert their will over their surroundings.

Part of that new research comes from Carol Dweck, best known for her work on Growth Mindset. In a 2015 study, she and a few colleagues set out to answer whether or not an individuals ideas about willpower could impact whether they had better or worse self-regulation abilities.

Through a semester, college students were tasked with responding to common self-regulation questions. How often did they overspend, did they overreact in anger, spend too much, procrastinate, or fail to manage their time. The students who had a limited view of self-regulation rated worse on three of the five metrics and consistently failed to exert willpower when necessary.

In contrast, those with an nonlimited view had not only better outcomes, but in more strenuous circumstances. Many of the students with a nonlimited view took on a heavier course load and end the term with a higher GPA than their counterparts.

Dweck and her team suggested a novel reasoning. Those with a limited view of willpower were more attuned to signals of depletion; fatigue, stress, frustration. As they began to feel them, they were more inclined to reduce their effort or take a break altogether to conserve resources.

Furthermore, those with a limited view may use their beliefs as a justification for their lack of effort. If they deem a task too demanding, it’s not their fault they won’t be able to complete it, they simply didn’t have enough willpower in the first place.

What this research proves is how impactful our view of the world is on our ability to navigate it. Those with a more positive view of their abilities tend to have more positive outcomes.

While simple belief may not drastically alter your life’s trajectory, paired with a suite of self-regulation strategies and tools it’s becoming increasingly clear that grabbing your life by the horns and directing it is real.

This research doesn’t directly support “fake it til you make it” as a lifestyle, but it does lend it credence. Our actions follow our feelings and beliefs.
