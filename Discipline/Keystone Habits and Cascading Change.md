### Introduction
- The myth of the complete life overhaul
- Why changing one thing can transform everything
- The concept of keystone habits (Charles Duhigg)

### Part 1: What Makes a Habit "Keystone"
- Creates small wins that build confidence
- Triggers spillover effects in other domains
- Creates structured time that organizes the rest of your day
- Shifts identity ("I'm the kind of person who...")
- Examples: exercise, morning routine, daily planning

### Part 2: Common Keystone Habits and Their Cascades
- **Exercise** → better food choices, improved sleep, increased energy, confidence
- **Morning routine** → productive day, less decision fatigue, sense of control
- **Daily planning** → prioritization, reduced anxiety, better time management
- **Sleep schedule** → improved willpower, better decisions, emotional regulation
- **One hour of deep work** → momentum, accomplishment, skill development

### Part 3: Identifying YOUR Keystone Habit
- Questions to ask: What area feels most controllable right now?
- What habit would create the most immediate positive feedback?
- What time of day do you have most control over?
- What would make you feel proud of yourself daily?

### Part 4: The Compounding Effect
- Week 1: The habit itself
- Week 4: First spillover effects appear
- Month 3: New identity forms, multiple domains improved
- Year 1: Completely different life trajectory

### Part 5: Common Mistakes

- Choosing a keystone habit that's too difficult
- Not giving the cascade time to develop
- Abandoning the keystone when adding new habits

### Conclusion
- Start with one, master it, let it cascade
- Patience with the process
- Your keystone habit is the first domino
