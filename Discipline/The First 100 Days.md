### Introduction
- The first 100 days determines if change sticks or fades
- Most advice focuses on starting; this focuses on continuing
- Understanding the phases helps you prepare for what's coming
- (Connects to "Just Do It" and "Short Term Success is not Habitual" articles)

### Part 1: The Three Phases of Habit Formation
**Phase 1: Honeymoon (Days 1-30)**
- High motivation, novelty, excitement
- Willpower feels infinite
- Small wins create momentum
- The danger: Mistaking motivation for habit

**Phase 2: The Grind (Days 31-60)**
- Novelty wears off, reality sets in
- First plateau appears (connects to Plateau article)
- Motivation drops, willpower required again
- The danger: This is where 50% quit

**Phase 3: Integration (Days 61-100)**
- Behavior starts feeling normal
- Identity begins to shift
- Habit becomes part of routine
- The danger: Complacency, letting other habits slip

### Part 2: Month-by-Month Breakdown
**Days 1-10: The Launch**
- What's happening: Excitement, new identity, lots of energy
- What to do:
  - Set up your environment (remove temptations, create defaults)
  - Start tracking immediately
  - Tell supportive people about your goal
  - Keep the habit small and achievable
- What to avoid: Over-committing, adding too many habits at once
- Warning signs: Already missing days, making excuses

**Days 11-30: Early Wins**
- What's happening: First evidence it's working, confidence building
- What to do:
  - Celebrate the streak
  - Identify and fix early friction points
  - Build if-then plans for common obstacles
  - Start seeing yourself as "the person who does X"
- What to avoid: Getting cocky, thinking it's already automatic
- Warning signs: Relying on motivation instead of routine, no system in place

**Days 31-45: The First Wall**
- What's happening: Motivation drops, novelty gone, life gets in the way
- What to do:
  - Return to your "why" - reconnect with the goal
  - Reduce the habit to minimum viable if needed
  - Use implementation intentions ("If X happens, then I'll Y")
  - Review and adjust your system (not your commitment)
- What to avoid: Quitting, waiting for motivation to return
- Warning signs: Skipping 2+ days in a row, "I'll start fresh Monday"

**Days 46-60: The Grind**
- What's happening: This is work now, not fun
- What to do:
  - Focus on process metrics, not outcomes
  - Find an accountability partner or community
  - Reframe: "This is where I build character"
  - Trust the system you built in phase 1
- What to avoid: Looking for shortcuts, abandoning the system
- Warning signs: Constant negotiation with yourself, "just this once" becoming frequent

**Days 61-80: The Shift**
- What's happening: Starts feeling more natural, identity shifting
- What to do:
  - Notice the automatic cues (time/place triggering behavior)
  - Reflect on how far you've come
  - Begin thinking about the next level (not new habits, but deepening this one)
  - Consider reducing tracking if it feels unnecessary
- What to avoid: Adding complexity too soon, complacency
- Warning signs: Boredom leading to experimentation that breaks the system

**Days 81-100: Integration**
- What's happening: Habit feels like part of who you are
- What to do:
  - Evaluate: Is this system sustainable long-term?
  - Make final adjustments for maintenance mode
  - Plan for upcoming obstacles (travel, holidays, life changes)
  - Consider whether you're ready to add another habit
- What to avoid: Declaring victory too soon
- Warning signs: Thinking you've "made it" and can coast

### Part 3: Warning Signs You're Relying on Willpower Instead of Systems
At any phase, these signs mean your system needs work:
- **You negotiate with yourself daily** about whether to do it
- **Your success depends on how you feel** that day
- **You can't maintain it when tired/stressed** (connects to Stress article)
- **You're constantly whiteknuckling** through temptation
- **You have no plan for obstacles** - you just "deal with it"
- **You haven't told anyone** or built any accountability
- **Your environment hasn't changed** at all

**The Fix**: Return to system-building (environment design, if-then plans, reducing friction)

### Part 4: The Critical Inflection Points (When Most People Quit)
- **Day 3-5**: Realize this will be hard
- **Day 21-25**: "Two week habit" myth makes people think they're done
- **Day 35-40**: First major obstacle (travel, stress, social event)
- **Day 60**: Plateau hits, no visible progress despite consistency
- **Day 90**: Boredom sets in, looking for next shiny goal

**Preparation is everything**: Knowing these are coming helps you push through

### Part 5: How to Know You've Succeeded
After 100 days, you've built a true habit if:
- You'd feel weird/off if you didn't do it
- It happens automatically at a specific time/place
- You don't debate whether to do it
- It's integrated with your identity ("I'm a person who...")
- You maintained it through at least one major obstacle
- You can do it even when motivation is zero

### Part 6: What Comes After Day 100
- **Maintenance mode**: Reduce tracking, trust the automation
- **Deepening**: Increase intensity/frequency now that foundation is solid
- **Expansion**: Add complementary habits (but only one at a time)
- **Teaching**: Help someone else build the same habit (solidifies your identity)

### Conclusion
- The first 100 days is the gauntlet - most quit, few persist
- Each phase has predictable challenges; prepare for them
- Willpower gets you started, systems get you to 100 days
- After 100 days, you're not just doing the habit - you've become the person who does it
- This is where lasting change begins
