- Removing temptation → creating defaults → full automation
- Which level is appropriate for different goals
- When to move up the spectrum vs. when simpler is better

## Article Ideas
- "Not all goals need the same level of preparation"
- The hierarchy of self-control interventions
- Why over-engineering your systems can backfire
- How to progressively automate your discipline
- When to stop optimizing and just execute

## Brief Outline

### Introduction
- Preparation is the core of self-control (connects to existing content)
- But there are levels to preparation
- Understanding the spectrum helps you match effort to goal importance

### Part 1: The Preparation Spectrum (Low to High)
**Level 0: Pure Willpower**
- No preparation, all in-the-moment resistance
- When it works: Rare, one-off decisions
- When it fails: Repeated temptations, daily decisions
- Example: Resisting dessert at a one-time event

**Level 1: Conscious Avoidance**
- Actively avoiding temptation environments
- Requires ongoing vigilance and decisions
- Example: Not walking down the candy aisle, declining happy hour invitations

**Level 2: Environmental Removal**
- Eliminate temptation from your environment entirely
- One-time effort, ongoing benefit
- Example: Don't buy junk food, delete social media apps, cancel subscriptions

**Level 3: Adding Friction**
- Make undesired behavior inconvenient
- Example: Freezing credit card, password-protected app blockers, gym across town

**Level 4: Creating Positive Defaults**
- Make desired behavior the path of least resistance
- Example: Meal prep on Sundays, gym clothes laid out, automatic savings transfers

**Level 5: Full Automation**
- Remove decision-making entirely
- Example: Automatic bill pay, meal delivery service, standing gym appointment with trainer
- Highest effectiveness, highest cost (time, money, or flexibility)

### Part 2: Matching Level to Goal Importance
- Not every goal deserves level 5 automation
- Questions to determine appropriate level:
  - How important is this goal? (Impact on life quality)
  - How often do I face this decision? (Daily vs. monthly)
  - How strong is the temptation? (Willpower required)
  - What's my current success rate? (If failing, move up spectrum)
  - What resources am I willing to invest? (Time, money, flexibility)

### Part 3: Examples Across the Spectrum
**Goal: Healthy Eating**
- Level 1: Avoid restaurants with tempting menus
- Level 2: Don't stock junk food at home
- Level 3: Keep healthy food visible, junk food in inconvenient places
- Level 4: Meal prep every Sunday, pre-portioned meals
- Level 5: Meal delivery service, personal chef

**Goal: Focus and Productivity**
- Level 1: Close tempting browser tabs when you notice them
- Level 2: Delete social media apps from phone
- Level 3: Website blockers, phone in different room
- Level 4: Scheduled deep work blocks, notifications off by default
- Level 5: Dedicated office space, assistant managing communications

**Goal: Financial Discipline**
- Level 1: Resist impulse purchases in the moment
- Level 2: Don't go to malls/shopping websites
- Level 3: Remove saved credit cards, unsubscribe from marketing emails
- Level 4: Automatic transfers to savings, separate checking/savings banks
- Level 5: Automated investing, all bills on autopay, accountant managing finances

### Part 4: When to Move Up the Spectrum
- You're consistently failing at current level (3+ times in a week)
- The goal has become high priority (life change, health issue, major financial goal)
- You've realized the cost of failure exceeds the cost of automation
- You've successfully maintained lower level for 3+ months and want to reduce effort

### Part 5: When to Move Down (or Stay Put)
- Over-optimization leading to rigidity and stress
- Life circumstances change (travel, new job, moving)
- The system requires more maintenance than the habit itself
- You've mastered the behavior and can reduce scaffolding
- The goal was temporary or has been achieved

### Part 6: The Progressive Automation Strategy
- Start at Level 2-3 for most goals (removal or friction)
- Master it for 30 days
- If struggling, move up; if comfortable, maintain or reduce
- Automate your keystone habits to highest level
- Keep flexibility in less critical areas

### Conclusion
- The best system is the one that works for you
- Start simple, add complexity only when needed
- Your most important goals deserve the highest automation
- The spectrum gives you options - use them strategically
