- The difference between data-driven and data-obsessed
- Why tracking everything can make you worse
- Leading indicators > lagging indicators
- The metrics that actually predict success

## Brief Outline

### Introduction
- "What gets measured gets managed" (Peter Drucker)
- But measuring the wrong things leads you astray
- The balance between feedback and obsession
- Understanding what to track transforms your discipline

### Part 1: Process Metrics vs. Outcome Metrics
**Outcome Metrics (Lagging Indicators)**
- What happened: weight lost, money saved, promotion earned
- Results of your actions, often delayed
- Useful for: Long-term evaluation, goal achievement
- Problems: Low frequency, outside your control, lag time creates confusion

**Process Metrics (Leading Indicators)**
- What you did: workouts completed, dollars saved, hours worked
- Actions within your control, immediate feedback
- Useful for: Daily motivation, system refinement
- Problems: Can do the process without results (if wrong process)

**The Key Insight**: Control the process, measure both, optimize the process

### Part 2: Examples Across Domains
**Fitness**
- Outcome: Body weight, body fat %, strength maxes
- Process: Workouts per week, protein intake, sleep hours
- Best metric: Consistency (shows up to gym 4x/week)

**Finance**
- Outcome: Net worth, investment returns
- Process: Savings rate, unnecessary purchases avoided
- Best metric: Automatic savings percentage of income

**Productivity/Career**
- Outcome: Promotion, salary, completed projects
- Process: Deep work hours, skills practiced, applications sent
- Best metric: Weekly deep work hours

**Relationships**
- Outcome: Relationship satisfaction, conflict frequency
- Process: Quality time scheduled, active listening instances
- Best metric: Phone-free conversations per week

### Part 3: Building Effective Feedback Loops
- **Daily feedback**: Did I do the thing today? (Yes/no)
- **Weekly feedback**: How many times this week? Trend up or down?
- **Monthly feedback**: Are outcomes starting to shift?
- **Quarterly feedback**: Major evaluation, system overhaul if needed

The faster the feedback, the faster you can adjust

### Part 4: When to Track
**Track when:**
- Starting a new habit (need data to know if system works)
- Debugging a failing system (where's the breakdown?)
- High-stakes goal (training for event, financial goal, health issue)
- You're the type motivated by data/gamification

**Don't track when:**
- The habit is fully automatic (unnecessary overhead)
- Tracking adds stress/anxiety (some people with food/body image)
- The metric is easily gamed (focusing on metric, not goal)
- You're tracking 10+ things (cognitive overload)

### Part 5: The Dark Side of Metrics
**Goodhart's Law**: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"
- Example: Tracking workouts → showing up but not trying
- Example: Tracking calories → eating 1200 cal of junk vs. 1800 cal of nutrition
- Example: Tracking hours worked → presence over output

**Metric Obsession**
- Weighing yourself 5x per day (noise, not signal)
- Tracking every macro to the gram (eating disorder territory)
- Productivity porn: optimizing tracking systems instead of working

**The Solution**: Measure the right thing, at the right frequency, with the right mindset

### Part 6: The Minimalist Tracking System
**For Most People, Track:**
1. **One keystone process metric**: Did I do my main habit today?
2. **One outcome metric**: Monthly check-in on results
3. **Weekly reflection**: What worked? What didn't? Adjust.

**That's it.**

**Tools**:
- Simple: Paper calendar with X's (Seinfeld's "don't break the chain")
- Digital: Habit tracking app (Streaks, Habitica, etc.)
- Advanced: Spreadsheet with weekly reviews

### Part 7: When to Trust Instead of Track
- Once you've hit 90+ days of consistency
- The behavior has become automatic (you'd notice if you missed it)
- You're maintaining, not building
- Your relationship with tracking becomes unhealthy

**The goal**: Track to build, trust to maintain

### Conclusion
- Measure process over outcomes
- Build feedback loops, but avoid obsession
- Track only what matters, as little as necessary
- The best system is the one you'll actually use
- Remember: The goal is the life change, not the perfect spreadsheet
