The work is bigger than us

Consistency doesn't care about failure

---

A lot of talk in the men’s self-help space that gamers are the antithesis of men who attract women.

This isn’t true.

The overlap between nerds and men unable to talk to women is nearly 100%. Gamers need to shut up about their hobbies until they’ve found someone who wants to learn about life. This is months not minutes into the relationship.

---

Your ability to grow is being subverted and captured by hedonic technology that are more than likely keeping you from growing up.

Video games, drugs, gambling, drinking, eating garbage are a way of life. They feel good while you’re doing it they handicap your life.

75,000 women agree that high agency and drive are sexier than wealth.

![[IMG_0050.jpeg]]

---

Women want a man with high drive and follow-through. This is the key single that a man is ready to start a family and will ensure a long, fruitful legacy for their children.

---

Self-compassion doesn’t look like letting yourself off the hook. It means holding yourself accountable so it doesn’t happen again.

When you love yourself, you will create a successful future for yourself.

---

For too long the positive thinking community took their failures and let them slide in the name of “self-love”.

But, this is never how you’d treat a child and it isn’t how you should treat your future self. Just like a kid who consistently makes mistakes a good parent will teach them to do better next time. They will set expectations and hold them accountable. They act as a guide to insure they move about the world in a way that will ultimately benefit them.

The self-love community wants you to believe that you are enough no matter what you look and feel like today. This view of the world is fine if you truly have no ambition for yourself, but anyone with agency will realize how destructive feeling stuck can be for mental and physical wellbeing.

I implore you to practice self-compassion instead. Set standards for yourself and address your failures. Create a future that you can be proud of.

---

Change is incredibly hard and that’s why only a few will ever shift from low agency to high agency, but I can’t insist on this enough - it is entirely possible for anyone to become a better version of themselves.

---

Women love a man with conviction. They want to know that they’re earnest in their pursuits. Nothing sexier than a man going after what he wants.

This personality trait is also a good indicator of a mature man. Boys are flirty, they jump from one thing to the next following their curiosity because commitment makes them fearful.

Intense focus is nothing to be ashamed of.

---

If your kid can read above grade level and understands how to use a computer there’s a really good chance they’ll outperform their average peers by an order of magnitude.

---

Mental and physical health share a universal baseline, but the ways individuals achieve those are unique to every single person.

Self-help then, should be about encouraging people to explore the things that make them tick rather than shoehorning them into a style of living.

---

Women and men who “hate men” are vile. They do nothing but hurt weak men and stunt boys development while high-agency men see parts of the world turning against them and deciding they are the enemy.

---

You could do anything, but you choose nothing day after day. Death will be your reprieve from shame.

---

You should spend time finding out what your highest possible mental load looks like. What could you do if you poured your heart and soul into it?

Most don’t even know what exceeding their physical peak looks like let alone their mental.

---

My nephew is in 8th grade. Not an outcast, but definitely not in the popular group. 80/20 female/male friendships. Very similar to me at that age.

The biggest difference? I played sports and video games at his age, he’s doing art and music. He spends too much time using therapy speak and alluding to the possibility he has autism. I had barely any idea what mental health was until high school.

Wondering if he grows up well-versed in emotional intelligence or has his brain-cooked by lib speak.

---

Talking to liberal friends. We all agree liberal principles of freedom of expression are good. Also agreed that ruthlessly destroying our peers for stepping out of line is bad. No path forward here.

---

Somewhere in the 2016 range competition fundamentally broke. We hit a point with phone saturation and internet access that made high agency individuals unstoppable and hit low agency people with a kill-shot of endless content and algoslop.

AI only intensifies things.

Raise your kid to push the boundaries. If you’re a young man reading this, you can snap out of it. Falling into the algorithm is an agency skill issue.

---

The solution here is to ensure young men understand that being a eunuch, suckling at the teet of social media is embarrassing

![[IMG_0048.jpeg]]

---

Bias toward action

Reject inertia

Kill resistance

Distraction and temptation are the enemy.

You have one life to live. Waste no more of it sitting idle.

---

The point of a cold shower is proving you can “do the hard thing”

The cold shower doesn’t do shit itself. It’s you standing in cold water and pushing through the mental anguish of not switching to hot.

You’re reinforcing that you have the willpower to do something difficult.

If your life is already hard. If you’re already working through, enjoy the warm shower.

---

I can’t force you to have agency but I can make sure you know how much better life is with it.

---

What level of psyop would you need to understand that you can do whatever you want

---

You can discover agency by going to the gym, writing, choosing the books you read, deciding to improve your skills.

Too much of what we do today is decided for us. You put your phone down only to pick it up seconds later because your brain thinks that’s the only option. Your content is spoonfed to you via algorithm and you do nothing but complain about it.

Create responsibilities for yourself, explore the things you’re curious about, face new challenges, give your life even the smallest amount of purpose.

---

When I say “that dude fucks” it’s not gay.

We’re going to cure your lack of agency or die trying

Restaurant bathroom was out of paper towels.

Low agency = walk out with wet hands wiping them on your pants like an asshole

High agency = opening the cabinets and finding a new set of paper towels for yourself and the people after you

Not having children of your own is fine. Endless ways to meaningfully contribute to society without passing those lessons directly onto your own kids.

---

You give into distraction because none of your mental models truly put you in charge of your life. You’re a side-character to your view of the world. You must act in certain ways and you can’t imagine taking control.

---

Everything you do needs to have a bias towards actions even the words you speak about the actions you’re going to take.

---

Similar to the Churchill view of how to structure work. He’d spend most of his early morning in bed, dictating work to his secretaries and answering the equivalent of emails.

The opposite in direct approach to karpathy, but similarly structured. He’d clear his busy work in the morning so he could do his work in earnest in the evening when he felt best suited.

My issue is solely with people who find kids disgusting. Or think we have too many people on Earth already.

The next generation is the most important and that is true for every child, everywhere. Our purpose is life is to help raise the next generation. Those who are so selfish they only think of themselves and their lives are the lowest form of life.

---

Too many people think abusing their bodies is how they harden themselves against pain and disappointment. They leave no time for enjoying their victories and constantly live in an abusive relationship with their own happiness.

They suffer from success in a uniquely hellish way and their mode of being is worthless for a modern society.

---

The way attention shifts from new and shiny object in crypto is ultimately how all things will be.

When they talk about AI creating everything custom to the individual in the future I don’t think they are wrong. Sure you may have some holdouts groups who overlap in their desires and so get bucketed in similar groups. But the content they interact with will change rapidly and they’ll pay endlessly for it.

---

Luck is a stat you can work on you just have to have a high degree of openness and a willingness to work!

---

Wealth is a primary driver of intelligence.

If you think every breakthrough, novel machine, philosophic idea, was created by someone with an 130+ IQ you sorely misunderstand how ideas come together.

Wealth gives individuals time, energy, less stress, and a higher degree of openness. Combine any of these with a moderate understanding of industry or technology and you’re certain to get novel ideas.

Sometimes I get sick with how fast things happen. The euthanasia coaster of virality is impossible to ride forever and nothing happens when you get off aside from missing out on some cheddar.

But damn if number goes up doesn’t draw me back in every few months.

When we’re the new elite how do we single to others that we made it rich off crypto?

---

You are too invested in how you view yourself to ever become the person you wish to be.

(skull laughing image)

---

There is no “later”. You will not pursue your dreams in the future. A person who habitually puts their dreams off will not miraculously become a person who fulfills them. It’s later than you think.

---

Your lack of audacity, courage, ambition, bravery are holding you back. Your ability and intelligence don’t have a say in the matter and they likely never will.

---

If you can prove to a woman that she is safe with you a lot of the other requirements will fade away.

Women don’t care about dollar amounts as much as they care about the safety attached to them. Cash in hand is an easy approximation for how much worry a woman will have to face day-to-day.

---

Do poor men think they will suddenly become dateable when they have money? The best decrepit wealthy men can hope for is greedy women.

Your ability to pull does not change with the amount of money in your pocket.

---

Action over theory.

---

Believing in God as a resource for your motivation and persistence.

---

Only met a few women who want their men to agree with them on everything. Most women have simply been with cowardly men who will bend-over backwards for their girlfriends. This puts women in a position of power they weren’t trained for and end up weaponizing it out of frustration. We call these women any number of names, but we should really be blaming the men who made them this way.

You should have strong opinions, respectfully disagree with your wife and girlfriend, demonstrate your ability to be your own man.

---

Humanities will to succeed makes me weep. I am so glad to be alive and be a part of all of this.

---

Traditional education is pretty fucked for a number of reasons and there is a window where this all gets better for everyone and our future generations. A dozen different ways this could or would play out, but the one thing I need everyone to understand is that today’s education system does not work for the vast majority of children, especially young men and boys.

---

Action over theory.

Be your own man. Follow the things that fascinate you. Quit scrolling for the next dopamine hit. Leave sarcasm out. Stop pushing the future further and further away.

Go for a long walk. Spend an hour in the gym. Grab a beer with the boys. Turn off the TV. Read a book. Follow your gut.

Write a book, paint a picture, draw on MS paint, sew up your ragged jeans, clean your house, break bread with your neighbors.

Help your coworkers, bless your family, give to those in need, be kind to strangers, hold the door open, top up your friends coffee, remind those you love that you love them.

Be strong. Act sincere. Embody the virtues you hold dear. Protect those who are kind. Lift up others. Love the world around you.

---

30 minutes a day without your phone, focused on things you’re passionate about is enough to distinguish you from all of your peers.

---

Too quick to attack yourself when you make a mistake. Too slow to pat yourself on the back when you succeed.

I’m pretty sure if we had an independent group come in and test high schools in all fifty states we’d learn some depressing statistics about the future of America.

---

You don’t need to “fix” yourself to start pursuing the things you want to do. Therapy is not a prerequisite to going to the gym. Healing trauma is not a pretext to starting a business. Finding yourself is not on the college admission form. Your future employer does not care if you’ve worked on yourself.

---

80% of men need to be more audacious. Too many risk-averse men who let themselves and their ideas get run over because they’re anxious about the outcomes.  
  
If you think your ideas are good you need to run them down. The path to success is not paved with acquiescence  

---

Even if your job is shit you should strive to be the best at it. Not even at your whole company, just your local vicinity. Pack groceries the most efficient. Stack shelves faster than anyone. Create the most impactful pivot tables. Write the most coherent emails.

Be a success in your locus of control.

---

Stop looking back at your wasted potential and start putting the work in. The future is still ahead of you. Ruminating in the past can do nothing for you.

---

~~15-minutes a day working on something your passionate about will do more for your soul than the countless hours you waste distracted.~~

5’11 is a very difficult height as a man. The incentive to lie is high (666), but if you’re found out it’s clear you have deep seated issues about your body.

![[image 1 2.png|image 1 2.png]]

---

If your women or friends talk about needing a man who meets the 666 criteria you need to run.

She has been marked by the devil. This is not a cute Tiktok trend. This is your soul on the line.

---

After tackling a difficult problem the best thing you can do for yourself and your mind is go for a long walk without any distractions. No phone, no music. Nothing but your mind and fresh air.

---

Out competing the world is as simple as understanding that not everyone knows what you know. Rightfully called the _curse of knowledge_ - your brains way of making you believe that you are no better than anyone else and if you understand something as simple everyone around you must know the same.

Overcoming this unlocks so much of life

---

You don’t need to be more frugal. You need to make more money.

---

Men should be the default problem solvers in the relationship

---

You should always diminish how hard you work. If people think you 10x their output in half the time it takes them you have no obligation to correct them.

---

If you’re trying to explain something in your field to someone outside of it, you must always condense it to the smallest steps. You should be thinking, “how do I explain this to a barely sentient child”. If someone calls you out for mansplaining simply ask them how they would explain it so you don’t make the same mistake in the future.

Too many people min-maxing their lives. Not enough just going out for a walk in the sun or lifting weights because it feels good.

---

Health, both mental and physical, are so driven by the individual that the concept of a perfect plan should be thrust from your mind the moment someone tries to sell you on it.

You should be taking a playful approach to both. The attachment to look and act a specific way only serve to corrupt your identity.

Starting to think that endless one-night stands are just as damaging to men as they are women. I don’t know a single promiscuous man that has a healthy relationship with the thought of women

Just hit 10M in sales (ASP 50k) or roughly 200 direct sales.

You cannot force people to buy something even if you know it’s good for them. They must have a forcing mechanism. It is better to move on to someone who has immediate pain than convince someone the pain they have is worth the cost of switching products.

---

Conscious, Self 1, The Tiny Man, Ego, our sense of self, are resistant to change. It’s nearly impossible to tackle them head on. It’s for this exact reason transformation happens through symbolic means or difficult times.

You snap your thinking self out of its habits and routines and force it to work with new understanding faster than it can acclimate.

---

The problem with putting an LLM at the forefront of religion is that they don’t have a single directive that pushes them forward. One that galvanizes their followers to them. They react to what the world wants and the moment a better LLM comes along followers will move on.  
  
AI cannot put forward a ten commandments style treatise and hold to it if its followers push against its ethos.  

  

You need something as stupid as a human to lead fearlessly.

You will often hear email workers tell you they are tired, but in the same breath that they only work a few hours a day. This is a skill issue, but it is the default way our brains work.

Let me explain

1. We were raised to believe jobs would have meaning. Millennials and some Gen Z were hit with wave after wave of “find your passion” and teachers would often tack onto that because that’s how they view their role. Reality quickly sets in after college. Entry level careers are never about passion. They are about proving yourself and paying off student loans and they absolutely feel that way. The dream you were sold was a facade and your brain tries to grapple with your new sense of being rather than getting over it.
2. There was a point in time where you learned on the job and that felt rewarding. After months of years, you’ve likely mastered your role. You might take this as a reward. You “get” to work for 2 hours a day because you’ve been doing this for so long. Others hit the moment of “is this all life is” and letting that become your reality is a sure fire way to feel depressed and low energy endlessly.
3. You’ve run out of studious peers (or at least stopped hearing about it). For 15-18+ years all of your peers are constantly learning. Some are voracious and put on pedestals by teachers or HiCap programs. Learning and education are aligned with “better than”. The drop-off here is immediate after college without dedicated intervention. When you’re in an atmosphere of learning you will learn too, even if it’s on something stupid like playing LoL better.

~~A large part of this generation is fitting into in-groups through neurodivergent behaviors and tendencies (see the rise in ADHD and “No really, I’m autistics”).~~

~~Reading “Inner Game of Tennis” was a huge white pill. I’ve read so much research around constructive self-talk and the impact of judgement on our mental state, but I was worried I’d never seen it applied broadly. It was something I could enact in my self. Expressing it to others seemed out of reach.~~

~~Now I realize I can just recommend a few chapters in a book and the whole message is unlocked~~.

I am so confident that the gym is a perfect introduction to “just do things” and “be delusional”. Weak men are so incredibly weak they have no idea how much stronger they can get in such a short period. It will break their brains to add 50lbs to their bench in 3-months. It’s the perfect, “you can just do things” because all you need to do is show-up.

It’s a shame what athletics has become in US schools.

The difference between a successful man and an unsuccessful one is their fixation on failures rather than looking to their failures as moments in time.

You can learn from each moment, but if you embody the failure you become failure yourself.

Hug your male friends. Tell them you love them. Push them to be more than themselves. Be honest with them. Let them know you care for them.

I can’t come up with a reasonable solution for this. I know the solution is that both of these men need to hear the advice from men they respect who’ve “solved” the problem in the listeners eyes. But that does not scale.

Trying new things is how you keep your brain young. The feeling of “getting it” will light up parts of your brain that your office job and routines can never reach. You need to be pushing yourself to gain new skills.  
  
Remember: No one can stop you, you can just start.  

---

We need to bake this behavior into the next generation of men. Camaraderie is how we push the world forward at breakneck space. Petty online arguments don’t serve anything but the ego.

Grudges occupy too much mental space and trick your brain into savior mode. They make you larger than life in your own head.

This is the easiest argument to view our society as continually accelerating. The difference even between older and younger millennials and their relationship with technology is stark.

The censored web is just one component of what separates younger and older zoomers. What I think is far more important is how they expect technology to function.

If you were born in the late 90s’ or early 00s’ there was a long stretch of time where technology frequently malfunctioned. Your internet connection was often spotty. It couldn’t do much even at the best of times. You were still reliant on printed maps to get around. Your entertainment was distinct from your communication tools. The interactions you had with people outside the immediate sphere of home, school, work were sporadic and almost always in person as staying on the phone was inconvenient in many homes. As technology developed young adults often had to learn with it. Connecting to wife, troubleshooting log-ins, jerryrigging downloads and broken apps. User-interfaces were confusing and designed with unclear outcomes in mind. Using technology had friction and it forced users to learn alongside it.

Today all of these things are instantaneous and the friction has vanished.

Young Zoomers not only experienced a sanitized internet, they do it in a way that gives them no reason to believe there is an uncensored internet they could be a part of.

We’re going to experience another massive shift soon. As AGI comes into play, the next generation will have a clear delineation between pre and post AI that will govern their interactions and expectations of how technology functions in their lives.

For the most part, and like every generation before me, I see a clear benefit to our collective well-being and an every clearer degradation in our personal experience and volition.

I’ll leave you with this excerpt from the Atlantic on college education.

This does not get better. The government cannot fix without drastic intervention and this is not what the government is good at. If you’re a parent or young adult correcting this for your kids or yourself is on you.

“You can just do stuff” is the most important life advice. The only person who can stop you is you.

---

~~When we say, “you can just do stuff” that includes bettering your community. Go pick up trash at the park or beach. Volunteer to read to kids (lots of programs for this), donate time and help feed the homeless. You can better yourself and your community! Humanize yourself and your surroundings.~~

This is the ultimate white pill. The world is ready to be molded. You need to take the reins.

Our world is filled with distraction and each successive generation is raised to lap it up. Gen Z is the last bastion of less than instantaneous world. The ability to focus is no longer built into our world. You can have your food delivered, your essays written, your shows and movies consumed and summarized in 60-second shorts. Everything you could need can be handed to you at a moment’s notice and while this has dramatically increased our well-being it’s had a significant impact on our ability to delay gratification and take action.

You can pull this same thread on any of the subgroups in Visakan’s tweet. Those stuck in the past, the people who gamble away their futures, who spend more time on drugs than sober, the ones who’ve given up on their ambitions.

The way to outcompete is truly as easy as being present. Your competition is lazy, unfocused, drugged, and absent. You have near infinite tools at your disposal as long as you can take action.

30-minutes of work, every day, will set you so far ahead of your peers in any realm you’ll be shocked at what you can attain in such a short period of time.

Your competition is barely trying. They are letting the world distract them from their goals. You can win if you can focus.

Two things happen when you become gainfully employed.

1. You can finally rest, reaching life’s pinnacle achievement
2. You are no longer around thousands of curious people engaging in learning

The first saps your ambition the second decreases the peer pressure to continue learning.

These are the “things” in Emily’s tweet. But, what do you do about them?

You need to start reading. And that doesn’t mean tweets or LinkedIn posts or your company Slack. You need to be reading full-on books with plots or narratives that take time and effort to get through. You need to sustain the ability to sit down, drown out the distractions of the world and work diligently through material.

If it’s been a long-time, start small. Read a novella or a short story (I’m happy to share recommendations I have hundreds).

Focus and concentration are a trained skill. They are foundational to your ability to learn and without them you will become “less intellectual” because your inputs now solely come from your work hours (which is likely less than stimulating) and your post work hours (which I know are less than stimulating).

Once you’ve regained the ability to concentrate, your next step is to start undertaking projects. When and if I get enough interest I’ll do a follow-up on what projects could and should look like.

*Yapcine is almost correct here. We have decades of studies that prove you do have self-control and that you can improve or manipulate it to your advantage.

Where he’s correct is the fact that you, especially if you’re reading this on Twitter, do have zero self-control. You are likely flinging yourself from one distraction to the next and trying to implement a routine where self-control would benefit you is worthless.

To control your environment you need to think about these three things (in order), your physical space, your mental space, and your digital space.

Your digital space is ironically the easiest to control. There are hundreds of apps that will help you limit and manage your screen time or access to distractions. USE THEM. They circumvent the need to “put down the phone” because the phone is no longer a distraction.

Your physical space is easy to control if you have money. If not, you should focus on finding spaces that fit your work needs. Quiet coffee shops, friends homes, your garage - spaces that make you feel like you _should_ be working. It’s easy to find out what works for your physical space. Go try out tons of environments and bring work to do in them. When your brain starts to get distracted by cars whizzing by or college kids yapping, learn from that. Those are things that you can control.

Your mental space is a crapshoot. I know nothing about you. The one thing I can say is trying to work when your head is filled with negative emotions is useless. Go for a walk instead. Give yourself mental space to process.

Once you have some mastery of these things, that’s when self-control comes into play. Volition lets you push through the physical distractions, ignore the draw of your phone, and tune out mental anguish.

Good luck!

Even if you found your dream girl there’s almost no chance you’d know what to do with her. Every man thinks they want a homemaker, a supportive wife, a loving partner.  
  
But they have no home to make, no dreams to support, and no love to share.  
  
There’s a lot of inner work that goes into being a man worthy of a “dream girl”

I don’t know what crackpot invented this theory but it has to be one of the most effective and mentally poisonous assumptions a person can have. I’ve never met an unhealthy person who doesn’t immediately dismiss exercise as an act for fools that couldn’t possibly help them because their unique mental state is beyond physical support.

Thinking you want something without understanding the reasons why seems like such a pivotal part of self-improvement. Spending ending hours working towards a goal only to reach it and have it feel hollow is such a mental reset in how you interact with the world.

Look around you! Look at how inefficient it all is! 10,000 reasons to make change. Your actions can shape the world. Destroy inertia!

The you that you think you are is preventing every bit of the person you could be.

Easy to shit on the “24 hours in a day people”, but if you stopped staring at your phone scrolling the timeline every day you’d realize how right they are.

The smallest men will complain about their partners never dressing up for them, but the best they can offer is a stay at home movie night while their friends are forced to plan “girls night” because its the only time they’re ever going to get to dress up.

Respectfully - You need to be shooting your shots without getting depressed after every rejection. Women can smell the inferiority on you.

I can’t wait to put down my roots and start getting active in my community. Everyone at the coffee shop will know my name. Gym owner is going to give me a 24 hour key even though the facility closes at 10. I’m gonna keep the streets clean. Single-handedly going to increase the property value of my entire neighborhood.

Your obsession with perfecting the process makes it impossible for you to get started.

Every day you do the work is a day and your competition posts online is one they can never get back.

Hobbies are hobbies because you can quit them and start them without shame or issue! they are supposed to be fun!

You can’t learn your way into personal growth and success. You have to take action at every step. Otherwise you’ll just become an encyclopedia of useless advice.

No one can stop you. Start. Start now. Build things. Do things. Research, write, code, learn, act.  
  
We are winners.

Truth of it is, if you get healthy today and start focusing on yourself and your community you could still live a happy life no matter what you’ve done in life to now.

I get excited every time I highlight the same kindle reads as hundreds of others. Love that we’re all in sync about the values that matter.

There isn’t anything as powerful as a natural inclination towards curiosity. You can outpace your peers with nothing more than a few minutes a day spent on purposeful learning.

Hawk Tuah going to be one of the last cases of someone extending their 15-minutes of fame into anything serious. Now that people see what they can do with that time the cycle towards abuse will get vicious and rapid.

It’s the right time to become an authentic taste maker. You have before Sam gets his 7T to complete make this happen.

Every day I’m on social media I’m shocked at how quickly time and fads move. The way brands and influencers immediately grab onto and deplete new trends to stay relevant has to break eventually, but I can’t fathom what it will look like.

Five signs your man isn’t in his masculine frame  
1. He keeps losing at his favorite video games. (he thought he was gonna go bro this is hard on his self-esteem)  
2. His favorite food is a vegetable (self explanatory)  
3. He started reading. (for who? for what? Whose he trying to impress? Look out ladies)  
4.

I'm on my Zeus energy. I'm channeling my inner divine. I'm communing with the old Gods. My spirit knows no bounds.

I’m going to make you life proof. You’re gonna wake up one day completely fucked over by some external event and end the day with a smile. You’re a god in mans clothing

Anne Frank, “How wonderful it is that no one has to wait even a minute to start gradually changing the world?”

Stop min/maxing the plans you make for your life. You must act! you must

Until you try to succeed your plans do not matter. they can’t matter. you have no idea what you’re doing you buffoon

“You have to do the ideal work of your managers before they’ll let you influence them.”

Their expectations of you are the foundation of your relationship with them. If you fail to meet expectations they will always attach a negative to your name. Once you exceed expectations you can start to dictate the future of your career.

---

I’m in my sunshine arc. I’m in my gold arc. I’m becoming a person who loves themselves more and more every day because I’m pushing myself to become better. There’s nothing I can’t achieve.

Sometimes I start a tweet and my shadow self creeps in and says no one cares.  
Then I remember that the only reason I’m online is to have fun and be myself.

String of Pearls. (how to change this to my own metaphor?)  
Each pearl is an action and each action has the same value  
What are the habits of taking action?  
I’m the person who puts the enxt peral on the string.  
Winnser are those who are willing to work the cycle and eat the mistakes.  
Every string has a turd. You can’t avoid it. You just have to put the next pearl on the string  

---

Talk to Your Shadow  
How does it feel about you?  
How do the parts of you that make you feel less than yourself feel about you now?  
Your goal is to tolerate what happens, not be perfect. It’s the process of relating not defeating.  
”I’m whole the way I am”  

---

Everything you have is temporary. Treat it with respect. Show gratitude for what life offers you.

---

Don't just talk about your ideas, demonstrate them through your actions.

---

The 0 to 100 mental assault I lay on myself the moment I realize I’m not blessed at a new hobby would shatter the average man.

---

Is it normal to stub our toe when we forget to do our chores? Do we deserve to go without food if embarrass ourselves? No, of course not. So if our otherwise well intentioned actions don’t deserve physical pain why should they cause emotional trauma?

---

Self compassion reminds us that we are humans who deserve to be at peace with ourselves. If you wrong someone attempt to make amends, but dont punish yourself in silence. That doesnt help anyone. It only strains the relationship you have with yourself and the person you hurt.

I’m an expression of this community the same way da Vinci was an expression of Renaissance Italy

The internet is a sacred place and a sacred process and we are part of it.

---

I’m as harmless as a snake, a shark, or a bear. Certainly not as bad as those humans.

---

I’m not shitposting, I’m moving to the rhythm, impulses, motivations, and urges of the internet

---

You just have to act. If you choose to plan when, where, how, all those little questions that get in the way of action will stop you from moving forward.

My unlived self is a manic shitposter incapable of slowing down.

There’s not a challenge on this Earth that can’t be overcome by man’s (an Americans) ingenuity.

---

Like mind control. People who talk more have a higher propensity to have their memes replicated.  
  
People who speak less frequently but with more gravitas also exceed others.  

---

~~You can evolve at a limitless rate because you can try new things. Your capacity for growth is uncapped. You’re amazing.~~

~~You just need to start~~.

---

The best memes all correlate sex, food, power, and community. This is the selling factor. Doing better gives you more control, more power, more possibilities

---

~~Do you want to care about what some jabroni on the internet thinks feels or says? No, you don't. It's a waste of your time.~~

You're experiencing inertia at every point in your life due to the habits you've created for yourself.

Everything you do is to keep yourself in the exact spot you are now.

You’re a perennial success at staying stagnant

---

Gonna stay in all my toxic relationships just in case past behavior isn’t the most reliable predictor of future actions

---

Telling my girlfriend “not to beat herself up about” missing my laundry while she cleaned my house.

---

You need to give yourself something to work toward and an expectation for your life.  
  
you must do these things in earnest. You can't half ass your lifes work. You cant half ass your expectations. Be serious so you can prvide ypurself an opportunity for happiness  

---

Most people accept themselves tacitly. They do not seek growth. They live their comfortable lives and complain when change doesn’t occur, but refuse to seek or pursue it even when it’s thrust in their face.

---

My entire self-worth is in the hands of others. I can’t trust myself with it.

People who labor all their lives but have no purpose to direct every thought and impulse toward are wasting their time—even when hard at work. - _Marcus Aurelius_

Men discovery their feminine side is inherently healthy, but far from the final stop to becoming a man.

---

The male perception of femininity is of weakness. So when men are asked to "act feminine" they believe they must show weakness. Yet anyone whos spent considerable time with women will know they show strengths in enumerable ways

---

~~A life of comfort and ease make it impossible for you to ever live up to your potential~~

Men should learn how to manage their pain, not just carry it. It is not a womans responsibility to bear the burdens of their partner.

Admire the bold, discard the timid.  
Timid men look especially weak in the eyes of the world because we are so often reminded of what a strong, commanding man can look like. Passive men are so easily walked over.
