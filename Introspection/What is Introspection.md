<center><h1>What is Introspection</h1></center>
Introspection is the examination of our mental processes, emotional experiences, and inner states that shape - and are shaped by - our consciousness and behavior.

Introspection and self-knowledge are distinct though closely related concepts. Introspection is the active process or method of looking inward - the act of examining one's thoughts, feelings, and mental states. It's the tool or practice we use. 

Self-knowledge is the resulting understanding or insight that comes from this examination, along with other sources.

Think of introspection as the act of looking in a mirror, while self-knowledge is everything you've learned about your reflection over time. Self-knowledge can come from multiple sources beyond introspection - feedback from others, observing our behavior in different situations, and seeing patterns in our life choices. Sometimes others can see aspects of ourselves more clearly than we can through introspection alone.

Introspection helps us answer questions about ourselves. It is one half of experiential self-knowledge. Imagine asking yourself, "what am I like?" Your view of yourself relies on introspection. If you have your family, friends, and coworkers they may answer in varied ways based on their perspectives. 

Introspection could be inquisitive. You may ask yourself questions about your thoughts, feelings, and [[Whose Goals|your motivations in life]].

A healthy practice of introspection can influence our self-efficacy 

Your average day is spent looking outward. Social media, news, tv. Your brain becomes filled with the ideas and beliefs of others. Or worse, so filled with jumbled thoughts it might as well be empty.

Introspection can even help us pursue our goals! Plenty of research indicates that the more internal alignment we have with our goals the easier it is to resist distraction and improve our ability to focus. This is intimately tied to our ability to  [[Three Factors for Improving your Self-Control#Increasing Autonomy|increase our autonomy]] and break free from the distractions of social media.  

In an introspective view, you're likely to describe yourself from your own perspective.
- I like sports
- I work in sales
- I enjoy quiet time

Rather than the views of the outside world.
- my coworkers say I work hard
- I am a good father
- My friends like spending time with me

No idea if this is true.

## Examples
Marcus Aurelius's Meditations: Originally written as private notes to himself, the Roman Emperor's personal reflections demonstrate how even one of the most powerful men in the world found value in daily introspection and self-examination. His writings weren't intended for publication but became one of history's most influential works on self-reflection.

Benjamin Franklin's Thirteen Virtues: Franklin developed a systematic method of self-examination, creating a chart to track his progress in cultivating thirteen virtues. Each evening, he would reflect on his day and mark any violations. This methodical approach to introspection led to significant personal growth and became a model for others.

Every religion has some practice of introspection.
