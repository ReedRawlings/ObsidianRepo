Subtitle: Designing Machines That Help Us Become More Human
## 1. Introduction: A New Kind of Progress
- The old dream: AI as efficiency, productivity, optimization.
- The better dream: AI as a mirror, guide, and catalyst for personal growth.
- Set the stage: What if AI wasn't just making life easier—but deeper?

When the world dreamt of AI it set humanity as the prime benefactor. The robots would take over the spreadsheets and we'd be free to write poetry and paint. What we got was the exact opposite. 

If I asked Gemini to build out a fiscal analysis for me I'd probably end up tearing my hair out yet when I want to generate a postmodern interpretation of how tariffs impact the midwest I can be confident Midjourney will give me an output I'm satisfied to see.

As we understand AI development today we're still a few years away from automating the mundane. There's a lot of nuance and specialize that goes into office work that we've never written down anywhere to teach the machines. 

So, now, we need a better dream. If AI can't yet give us our time back what can it offer? 

A better dream would allow AI to act as our therapists, a guide, and a catalyst for personal growth. If you look at how people are using AI today, you'll find that the vast majority are using it for entertainment and companionship. 

We aren't far off from flipping a switch where instead of AIs acting as tools of sycophancy they act as gurus and coaches to enhance their users lives.

## 2. Understanding Eudaimonic Well-Being
- Quick contrast: Hedonic (pleasure) vs. Eudaimonic (meaning, growth).
- The six pillars (Ryff):
  - Self-acceptance
  - Personal growth
  - Autonomy
  - Purpose in life
  - Environmental mastery
  - Positive relationships
- Why it matters now more than ever in a distracted, drifting world.

There are two paths forward for human and AI interactions; hedonic and eudaimonic. Hedonic interactions follow our current technological path. You spent more time consuming content on your phone. Every app maximizes for screen time and engagement and has no consideration for how this would impact the user. 

Eudaimonic interactions promote meaning and growth. If you had an app like this it would likely tell you to spend more time with friends and less staring at screens. To fix your diet, go outside and get a little exercise. These apps have a tough time competing with hedonic apps because they force the user to generate their own entertainment.

Where Tiktok says, "here look at me for a few hours", a eudaimonic app asks you to plan and execute your leisure. 

In a perfect world we'll design artifical intelligence to promote eudaimonic well-being  while only boutique shops will design hedonic apps. 

Today we're seeing the exact opposite, but that doesn't mean we're stuck on our current path. As many of these intelligences start to develop deeper relationships with their users there are so many directions we can head that will enhance humanity.

## 3. AI as a Tool for Human Flourishing
- How current AI could align with eudaimonic principles.
- Examples:
  - Personalized learning for personal growth.
  - Reflective journaling/chatbots for self-acceptance and clarity.
  - Goal-setting and progress tracking for autonomy and mastery.
  - Community-building algorithms designed for deeper connection.
- Reframe AI as “inner tech,” not just outer convenience.
Current AI can easily create personalized learning paths to teach users any subject. In almost all cases an AI can also act as the teacher. 

Personalized growth is an easy contender for human flourishing. Many of us need mentors and coaches to help us make decision, improve in areas we haven't developed, or push us toward the right path.

Reflective journaling chatbots are the easiest path forward. An ideal app would help users track their self-described happiness score, any activities they do in a day, and periodic journaling. It's difficult for an individual to track all this and then analyze that data, but this is the perfect task for artificial intelligence. 



## 4. Challenges: What We Must Get Right
- Ethical pitfalls: surveillance, manipulation, false agency.
- How the wrong incentives (ad revenue, engagement loops) undermine well-being.
- Call for values-driven design: building AI aligned with human development, not distraction.

We already have algorithms that learn users behaviors and preferences and do whatever is possible to serve up the right content at the right time to keep them engaged. According to Tiktok itself the average user spends 90+ minutes daily on the app. 

We've recently discovered that AI can enhance these algorithms in a number of ways. 

## 5. A Vision for the Future: Becoming More Human
- What life could look like with eudaimonic AI:
  - People in alignment with their values.
  - Stronger inner compass.
  - A generation of creators, not consumers.
- Tie it back to agency: AI can’t give you meaning—but it can help you reach it faster, deeper, and with more clarity.

## 6. Conclusion: The Most Important Question
- Not: “What can AI do?”
- But: *“What kind of people can we become—with the right help?”*
