<center><h1>Privacy in the World of AI</h1></center>

Are we cooked chat? It sure feels that way.

AI can track me based on my gait, it can find my location based on the background of my photos, a new AI can tell if a person is male or female based on their eye, another can reconstruct a face based on a picture of their ear.

Let's pause for a second and think about the last decade of privacy concerns, controls, and laws.

Thanks to the EU we have to click a little pop up to acknowledge websites are tracking our cookies. This took years to get into place and to this date 99% of people click "accept" (don't look this up). Cookies are pervasive, tell companies a lot about our browser history and habits online. It makes sense to give consumers a way to disable them. It's also clear how websites can disable cookie tracking for users. 

Can we say the same for pictures or our ears or eyeballs? What about the backgrounds in our pictures? How about videos of us walking? Every senior in the US has a video of their gait online somewhere.

The examples I listed were experiments. They are pet projects dreamed up by people who wanted to see what was possible. Their actions weren't malicious, they were curious about a problem and solved it with technology.

Today software is evolving faster than any one person can keep up with it. There will be hundreds if not thousands of these same experiments. We aren't even capable of thinking of the ways that technology can invade our life. 

Have you ever seen a movie where they reconstructed a face based on a single ear? No, because it sounds so silly. It would rip you out of the scene. Yet, here we are. 

I try to think through the ways that you can keep your life private and I can not wrap my mind around it. "Just go to the mountains", have you seen how cheap a drone is? It's $20 straight from China. One kid wants to check out the mountains and my whole compound is on the internet. If the drone catches me walking they can identify me. 

I'm of the mindset that your only option is to give in. Let everything about you end up online and simply don't draw any real attention to yourself.

If you have money you should never let another person know about it.
