How does the world look when AI takes over?
- Jobs give you security and economic agency. Losing that is scary. People want meaning, purpose, self-esteem, and control over their own lives (jobs give this). 
- For some people its a few of cultural beliefs
- It's their livelihood. Its what makes them feel like a man
- What is your live style going to look at after the fact? What will your day-to-day look like in a post labor economy? A retirement? 
	- Leisure class; poetry, consulting, debating (but all these things can now be done by AI)
- It's going to be more important to have a tribe. A group of people you can spend time with just for the sake of it. 
- Others will likely fall into cybernetic worlds where they interact with other people and AI. The real world will be less and less material to them.
- There will be plenty of time to do whatever you want with your life.
- "I take my dogs to the park, not because it creates value but because it's something fun to do."
- "What if billionaires just keep making more money forever. "
- Read, Why Nations Fail
- "Will we be able to build great things? Will we be able to direct AI to create a better future for us or will it run amok?"
- Agency is crucial to the post labor economy. What will you do with your free time?
- People need their tribes. A small group of people they enjoy the time of. Whats to stop AI from becoming the tribe?
- "It is far beyond Economy. This is the struggle for purpose and meaning. Apparently it is surprising that a machine built to replace you is not welcomed by those who still wish to exist" - @M1ndPrison on X
