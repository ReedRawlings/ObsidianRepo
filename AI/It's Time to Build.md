https://x.com/signulll/status/1988753906055409782?s=12 - Instead of starting a new AI product. it's time to start doing what AI has promised and that's build.

we have thousands of generative tools now but as Satya Nadella said recently we're not exactly seeing a massive change in productivity.

There's a lot to be said about why that is, that gen AI still can't quite get things right especially over larger contexts, or that good prompts are still a skillset that people need to learn, but I think most of that is bullshit.

The real problem instead is that people don't like to put effort in. Regardless of how simple things become there is still a zero to one problem to solve and even after you start there is the process of molding a final outcome. A process that most people are completely unfamiliar with.

I'm going to challenge myself, and anyone reading this, to start working on their 5-9 in earnest. Generative models have gotten to the point where you really can put almost any text down and get an output close to what you want.

It's on you to take that output and make it your own. Your writing. Your art. Your code. Your music. Your business. Whatever it is, just polish it and make it yours.

You might argue that this is harder said than done and that's true, but it's also never been easier to start so you owe it to yourself to give it a try.

I recently took two weeks off in Hawaii on a very active vacation. Lots of driving, hiking, and a decent amount of time lounging poolside.

In that same period I came up with three apps, validated their PMF through research, and got them 90% done. I wrote three articles and did a ton of research.

Generative AI was crucial in this process. 

It helped a ton with research. I used to spend hours just finding the right resources, pouring over reviews, digging into sources. Now Gen AI does that for me. I still have to verify them, but I had to do that anyway! 

Gen AI helps me come up with ideas on where my writing is missing gaps. This has a profound impact both on my speed to finished post but also the message I'm sending out to the world.

Gen AI coded the entirety of my apps. I did a lot of human testing and setting the foundation, but otherwise was completely hands off. I would have never been able to accomplish this without AI and for that I'm eternally grateful.

We'll continue to see more people create AI tools but it's far more important to show what's possible with them instead. That's going to be my goal for the next few months.
