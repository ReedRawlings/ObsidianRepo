# Whats the target audience

- The audience isn’t just men, it’s men who can create a future state for themselves or have a desire to become a better version of themselves.

## Story Brand
A character who wants to take control of their lives. Their attention is stolen, they're capable of more, they weren't meant to live such a passive life. Their enemy is distraction and drift. They meet a guide who reassures them they weren't meant to spend all day consuming. Their guide gives them a plan to make lasting change and calls them to break free of passivity. 

If they fail they're destined to live devoid of intention. If they succeed they take control of their future and transform into an inspired and self-assured hero

## Whats the Ethos

- The work is bigger than us
- Win, and help win. 
- It's never been easier to be an outlier

Whats the brand

- 
- Stay Golden Boys
- “For those who may love themselves for their identity, but not their character or who they’ve become. You can improve yourself without changing the self.”
- 


# Golden Rules

- When you make up problems you have to come up with solutions. Easy to beat up on news and doom-posting. You need to provide a way to rebel
- People fucking love quotes
    - It allows them to feel as though they’re part of the community “similar expressions of feelings” and that they’ve gleamed knowledge by taking something away from the experience
- Use multiple media types wherever possible.
    - Breaking up reading with visual stimulants gives readers a break from reading
- You're not in a competition with others!
    - Reach out and ask for help!
