The new workplace trend is not employee friendly. Artificial intelligence and automation technologies are advancing at blazing speed. A growing number of companies are using AI to streamline operations, cut costs, and boost productivity. Consequently, human workers are facing [facing layoffs](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tech-layoffs-artificial-intelligence-ai-chatgpt/), replaced by AI. Like it or not, companies need to make tough decisions, including layoffs to remain competitive.

Corporations including Klarna, UPS, Duolingo, Intuit and Cisco are replacing laid-off workers with AI and automation. While these technologies enhance productivity, they raise serious concerns about future [job security](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/08/business/ai-job-losses-by-2030-intl/index.html). For many workers, there is a big concern over whether or not their jobs will be impacted.

Economic pressures, inflation and roller coaster stock prices, have pushed firms to prioritize leaner operations. The result is there will be fewer human jobs available. Investor enthusiasm for AI [rewards companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/once-decade-buying-opportunity-1-074500603.html) that deploy the technology. We’ve seen numerous occasions in which AI was used in corporate announcements, and their stock share prices rose higher.

## Klarna

Klarna, a leading buy-now-pay-later fintech company, made headlines in 2022 when it announced the elimination of over 1,000 jobs, [or about 10%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2022/05/24/klarna-is-the-latest-victim-of-the-economic-downturn-laying-off-10-of-its-staff/) of its global workforce, as part of a strategic shift toward AI, the company’s CEO announced.

The company heavily invested in AI to handle customer service inquiries, process transactions, and optimize its operations. Klarna implemented an AI assistant that manages the workload equivalent to [700 full-time staffers](https://www.klarna.com/international/press/klarna-ai-assistant-handles-two-thirds-of-customer-service-chats-in-its-first-month/).

CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski has openly discussed how AI-driven chatbots and automated systems can perform tasks once managed by human agents, such as answering customer queries and processing refunds. By integrating generative AI, Klarna aims to cut [operational costs](https://tech.co/news/companies-replace-workers-with-ai) while scaling its services, with reports suggesting that AI now handles a significant portion of its customer interactions.

## UPS

In early 2025, UPS announced plans to lay off 20,000 workers, marking one of the largest workforce reductions in its 116-year history. CEO Carol Tomé highlighted that new technologies, including machine learning, enabled these cuts by automating tasks like proposal generation for sales teams, which previously required human pricing experts.

While UPS clarified that AI isn’t directly replacing workers, the adoption of AI-driven tools to enhance efficiency in logistics, route optimization, and customer interactions suggests automation played a role in reducing the need for certain positions. These developments underscore how logistics giants are using [AI to trim costs](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-05-03/ups-usps-job-cuts-impacts-on-service-explained) while navigating rising inflation.

## Duolingo

Duolingo, the popular language-learning app, announced its “AI-first” strategy. The plan is to phase out human contractors for tasks artificial intelligence can handle. CEO Luis von Ahn’s all-hands email, shared on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/news/story/duolingo-to-swap-contractors-for-ai-6785921/), outlined a future whereby AI drives content creation, performance reviews, and hiring decisions.

Duolingo terminated agreements for 10% of its contractor workforce, citing a pivot to AI for content translation. A company spokesperson acknowledged that AI contributed to this decision, as automated systems could now handle tasks like translating course materials across its 100+ language offerings.

While Duolingo emphasized that no permanent employees were laid off, the move signaled a clear shift toward AI-driven content creation, reducing reliance on human translators. Even creative industries, once thought immune to automation, are adopting AI to replace tasks usually [performed by contractors](https://www.linkedin.com/news/story/duolingo-to-swap-contractors-for-ai-6785921/).

## Intuit

Intuit, the financial software company behind TurboTax and QuickBooks, laid off about 1,800 employees in 2024, saying the savings would be reinvested in AI technology. The company’s leadership described AI as a critical component of its future strategy, notably for automating customer support, data analysis and the tax preparation process. By [replacing human workers](https://www.linkedin.com/news/story/intuit-lays-off-1800-hires-1800-6093100/) with AI tools, Intuit aims to enhance efficiency and stay competitive in the rapidly evolving fintech sector.

## Cisco

Cisco announced plans in 2024 to lay off 7% of its workforce, roughly 5,900 employees, as part of a strategic pivot toward high-growth areas like AI and cybersecurity. The company has been integrating AI into its networking solutions, such as predictive analytics for network management and automated customer support systems.

While Cisco’s layoffs were framed as a realignment to focus on emerging technologies, the adoption of AI tools to handle tasks like network monitoring and troubleshooting suggests that automation reduced the need for certain roles. This case highlights the broader technology industry trend of [downsizing human](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/cisco-s-second-2024-layoff-5-600-jobs-cut-shifts-focus-to-ai-growth-124091901164_1.html) workforces while scaling AI capabilities.
